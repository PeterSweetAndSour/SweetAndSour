<p><strong>[Update 29-May-10: <br />The canoe has been stolen from the garage at 1222 Constitution Ave NE! It has <a href="/canoe/images/IdentifyingMarks.jpg">identifying marks</a>, specifically a serial number 110726 and the name &ldquo;J. Charette&rdquo; carved into one of the timbers.]</strong></p>

<p>This canoe is work of art and we bought it because it was so beautiful even though, at the time, we had no place to store it and we had to drive from Washington DC to eastern Tennessee to collect it! Sadly, almost 3 years later, we still have no place to store it so it's been in friends' garages ever since, first in North Carolina and then in southern Maryland. We live in a highrise apartment but thought we would have bought a house by now. We haven't, so perhaps it's time to move on and part with the canoe.</p>
<p>It's been used 6 times while we've owned it but I do not know how old it is or how many previous owners there were.</p>
<p>This model, the <a href="http://www.amtraders.com/c-detail.asp?Model=Feather&Material=WE" title="American Trader Feather">Feather</a>, is still produced and as you can see on the American Trader web site, the quality and craftmanship is reflected in the price. The site also has additional information on <a href="http://www.amtraders.com/c-epoxy_vs_canvas.htm" title="Construction details">construction details.</a> As the name suggests, it is lightweight at 49 pounds and can be carried on the shoulders by an adult. It's also reasonably car-toppable &ndash; we've drove it back from Tennessee on top of our Ford Escort wagon as shown.</p>
