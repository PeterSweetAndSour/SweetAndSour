   <p>Before we go any further, I should point out that if I had my time over again, I would not waste my time studying books I never understood, or calculus I never used, but studied electric guitar instead.  I can't play any instrument but I wish I had started when I was young when my brain was still developing.  It's too late now.</p>
   <p>In any case, I think that if you are not famous by age 25, you've missed the boat, or at least you have to be outstandingly good or lucky.  To borrow a line from Cold Chisel, "the money I saved can't buy my youth again".</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, these bands provided a soundtrack to my youth and a lot of enjoyment.  I only saw four of them live.  If a band has a home page, I've linked to it but most of them disbanded long ago.</p>
   <p>What follows are the bands that I liked and I've written a little of my impressions of each.  All opinions are entirely my own and you will probably have different ideas.</p>
   <p>If your Australian and in your mid-30s, it's time to reminisce.  If not, enjoy the ride.</p>
