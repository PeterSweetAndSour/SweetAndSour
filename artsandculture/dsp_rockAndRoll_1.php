<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>[2020 update: I believe this was the first section I created for my site in 1999! It is obviously out of date but this is really about the music I enjoyed when I was young so it hardly matters.]</p>
	<p>Before we go any further, I should point out that if I had my time over again, I would not waste my time studying books I never understood, or calculus I never used, but studied electric guitar instead.  I can't play any instrument but I wish I had started when I was young when my brain was still developing.  It's too late now.</p>
	<p>In any case, I think that if you are not famous by age 25, you've missed the boat, or at least you have to be outstandingly good or lucky.  To borrow a line from Cold Chisel, "the money I saved can't buy my youth again".</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, these bands provided a soundtrack to my youth and a lot of enjoyment.  I only saw four of them live.  If a band has a home page, I've linked to it but most of them disbanded long ago.</p>
	<p>What follows are the bands that I liked and I've written a little of my impressions of each.  All opinions are entirely my own and you will probably have different ideas.</p>
	<p class="endText">If your Australian and in your mid-30s, it's time to reminisce.  If not, enjoy the ride.</p>

<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Let's see how we got here.  When I was young in Sydney, there was radio station 2SM and <i>CountDown</i>.  Who could forget? </p>
   <p>2SM was the radio station that played all the Top 40 hits and since there were so few stations in the 70s, it was youth radio.  It was decimated when FM arrived around 1980 offering far better sound but the licensing arrangements didn't allow them to transfer to the new band at the time.</p>
   <p><i>CountDown</i> was the TV music show of its day and made Molly Meldrum a household name in Australia.  It was on the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission, roughly the equivalent of PBS and NPR rolled into one).  Since it had national reach, none of the commercial stations could effectively compete and it was the launch pad for many bands.  The show ended almost every week with a countdown of the top 10 (hence the name) culminating in playing the film clip for number 1   I say "almost" because <i>Abba's "Fernando"</i> was #1 for so long that everyone got sick of it and they stopped playing it!  Did you see the 20th anniversary show in 1993?  It was a blast!</p>
   <p>ABC radio launched 2JJ or Double J with Skyhooks song <i>"You just like me because I'm good in bed"</i>.  It set the pattern for cutting-edge, provocative music programming and being government, it was mercifully free of advertising.  Double J became <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/triplej.htm" target="_blank">Triple J</a> with the move to FM.  Often they played garbage because it was new and different but there were gems thrown in and it was up to the audience to decide which was which.  Rap was played years earlier on Triple J than any of the commercial stations.</p>
   <p class="endText">The tradition continues, more or less.  I believe they have a playlist now (they didn't in the early days) but there is little overlap with the commercial stations.  Sometimes this is good as it avoids endlessly- repeated, over-packaged American pop but it also means you need to listen to the commercial stations some of the time just to find out what's happening in the outside world where there is some endless-repeated, good Australian music.</p>
