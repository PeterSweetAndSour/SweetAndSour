<h3>Really, really small pictures</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>A fascinating (if you are an engineer) look at pictures that have been engraved on to commercial integrated circuits amongst the &quot;wires&quot; and transistors.  Most are only a fraction of a millimeter across. The pyramid at right showing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States" target="_blank" class="external">Great Seal of the United States</a> is just one example. You can waste a lot of time here.</p>

<h3>The Economist style guide</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Ever wondered whether to put the full-stop inside or outside the quotation marks if the quote ends the sentence?  Maybe not but it is a great reference for everyday clear, consistant writing covering punctuation, grammar, capitalization etc.  I was so excited to find it because I need help from time to time.  Since <i>Tthe Economist</i> is British, it follows "the Queen's English" so it is proper.  Go to <a class="external" href="http://www.economist.com" target="_blank">The Economist</a> and then select the Library icon at the top of the page and scroll down a bit.</p>
   <p class="endText">Incidentally, <i>The Economist</i> is arguably the best news-weekly magazine anywhere.  Larry Ellison, head of Oracle has said, <i>&quot;I used to think. Now I just read The Economist.&quot;</i>.</p>
