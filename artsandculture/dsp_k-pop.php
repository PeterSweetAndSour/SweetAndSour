	<p>When I was on the Global team at The Motley Fool we had a wonderful intern named Chandler who had a list of &ldquo;My five favorite&hellip;&rdquo; on a range of topics including Korean pop music a.k.a. K-pop. I didn't care so much for the first, second and third but then <em>Cheer Up!</em> blew me away and I haven't looked back since! Thank you Chandler. There is so much great music coming out of Korea that it is hard to keep up with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why K-pop is different&mdash;and awesome</h2>
<div class="story">
	<p>There are a handful of big entertainment companies and a bunch of smaller ones that hold auditions for those who think they can be a star and in practice, this means 13, 14, 15-year olds. (Here is the information page for <a href="https://audition.jype.com/en" target="_blank" class="external">JYP Entertainment's auditions</a> for example. You can read in the original Korean if you wish though it is not strictly necessary to speak Korean.) Alternatively, one of the company scouts might <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/02/19/2018021901784.html" target="_blank" class="external">spot you while shopping</a>, think you have the look and personality they want and ask you to audition.</p>

	<p>As I understand it, if a child is selected then they leave regular school and move into the company dormitory and will then spend the next few <em>years</em> training more or less full-time in singing and dance. There are constant evaluations and some will drop out. Trainees must behave appropriately in public, are told what to eat, have very limited contact with their families, or anyone else in the outside world and are not allowed to date &ndash; the myth created is that K-pop stars are desirable but yet somehow &ldquo;available&rdquo;. Indeed, the agreements have been called <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-25/k-pop-s-gross-double-standard-women" target="_blank" class="external">slave contracts</a> and girls may be required to get cosmetic surgery!</p>

	<p>Then in their late teens they will be assigned, or compete for, a place in a group &ndash; all girls or all boys &ndash; and they will debut. By then, after years of practice they should be amazing&hellip; but they are the only visible part. The company employs/contracts song writers, musicians, choreographers, hair stylists, mark-up artists, fashion designers and video/sound producers and technicians to make a complete &ldquo;product&ldquo;.</p>
	
	<p>It is worth mentioning that the unblemished image created for K-pop idols means that the lyrics and the music vidoes are free from overt sexual overtones and as best I can tell from subtitles, no one swears. Performers and anyone else in the videos are fully clothed (though I will concede that skirts/dresses can be very short but they wear shorts for safety; it seems that even women showing belly buttons is a bit taboo in Korea). So, good clean fun.</p>

	<p>Hopefully the song is a hit and the trainee becomes a star (fans will adore them but they are merely company employees and the company takes the money) but that can bring its own set of pressures, sometimes with tragic consequences as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42393242" target="_blank" class="external">suicide of SHINee singer Jonghyun</a> demonstrates. More likely your catchy, beautifully executed song will get the interest of a small group of fans that will love it but most will never hear it and after a few years, the group will be disbanded. I make a point to listen to some of the lesser-known groups as some of their songs are as good as any and it is sad that they get so little recognition.</p>

	<p>Interestingly, K-pop has a known starting point in the way that <em>Rapper's Delight</em> is for hip hop. In April 1992, 3-member <strong>Seo Taiji &amp; Boys</strong> appeared on a talent show on MBC, one of Korea's TV networks performing a highly choreographed song that featured rapping. The judges were baffled and they came last. However the public loved it and the song was #1 in Korea for 17 weeks! The song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKK0UEu4Q5g" target="_blank" class="external">I know</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<div class="story">
	<p>If K-pop is completely new to you, I suggest that you start with the following, each of which are mentioned again below</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A song from the most popular boy band:<br/>
			<? setThumbnail("BoyWithLuv.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA", "figure--thumbnail-youtube"); ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			A song from the most popular girl group:<br />
			<? setThumbnail("CheerUp.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7rCyll5AeY", "figure--thumbnail-youtube"); ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			Not really standard K-pop as it is a solo act with no dancing but it is beautiful (more explanation below):<br />
			<? setThumbnail("EyesNoseLips.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9un35OyWcN0", "figure--thumbnail-youtube") ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			A fantastic song from a girl group that even K-pop fans probably know of only dimly, if at all. A great example of why you shouldn't limit yourself to just the most popular:</br>

<h3>BTS</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>I have to mention boy band BTS first because if you have heard of any K-pop group, it was almost certainly BTS as they are huge. They generate more traffic on Twitter than either Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber. They are unusual in that they write a lot of their material</p>
	<p>I love their 2019 hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA" target="_blank" class="external"> Boy With Luv</a> (791 million views as of 2020-05-28) but that was the first song of theirs that I liked.</p>
	<p>	It is definitely also worth watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzvfbRbEjww" target="_blank" class="external">&ldquo;dance practice&rdquo; video</a> so you can see the whole performance start to finish. In fact, I often prefer the dance practice videos and the live performances to the music videos. Indeed there is a huge sub-genre of dance covers and &ldquo;KPop in public&rdquo; performances where dance groups from around the world reproduce, or reinterpret, songs from popular groups. For <em>Boy With Luv</em>, I encourage you to check these out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6dRljmvGw" target="_blank" class="external"> 7 young men from Vietnam</a> (over 9 million views!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMDS5v4brj8" target="_blank" class="external">a rotating cast of dance groups</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TATGqCXMjj0" target="_blank" class="external"> 5 Korean? girls on top of a building</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adOK0WFu90&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821733000">a fabulous collaboration of 3 members each from 4 girls groups</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>&hellip;and so on.</p>

	<p>Someone at my old office (Dilene) gave me this list of <em>her t</em>en favorite songs. See if you like them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMdTd9e-LEI">I need U</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eotYGFuLKXM" target="_blank" class="external"> Best of me</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc">Blood sweat &amp; tears</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs" target="_blank" class="external"> Boy in luv</a>
			Click on [CC] control to turn on subtitles. I found the lyrics disturbing, especially 
			<br /><em>&ldquo;Hold tight on to me/before I jump on you.&rdquo;</em>.

<h3><span>Twice</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>
		If there was a song in my head since mid-2015, it was probably one of theirs. They are wonderful! As with most K-pop, it is not serious music but it is so much fun! Three of the members are Japanese and one is from Taiwan which led to a 
			<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2016/01/21/twice-bitten&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821737000">diplomatic incident</a>
		 with China in 2016. Their songs all have bits of English in them, especially in the chorus, which is good marketing since it is everyone&apos;s second language no matter where you are in Asia. I think all the official music videos have English subtitles too.

By way of comparison, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3KA6WDAYPM" target="_blank" class="external">Dahyun's emotional solo</a>; I think the style is better suited to the lyrics of the song. 
			This song comes after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/48948583&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821747000">Mina had to withdraw from performing</a> and her part starting at 1:30 addresses her crisis.

			2019-10-29: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlPHkOAT8hs" target="_blank" class="external">Luv Me</a> This is one of my favorite songs of theirs and until this live performance in Tokyo was posted, it only existed as a &ldquo;fan video&rdquo;. You will notice that Mina is back on stage as she felt comfortable enough to be on stage in Japan and you can hear the crowd show their appreciation when she sings.

<h3>Taeyang</h3>
<p class="subtitle">(From Big Bang.)</p>
<div class="story">
	<p>I believe <strong>Big Bang</strong> were the biggest K-pop group before BTS but I have yet to find any of their songs that I really like. Two of members have done significant solo work since but the band had to break up because the members had to do their military service.</p>
	<p>However, I have to mention that one of the other members, Seungri who was part owner of the Burning Sun nightclub, was in a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48702763" target="_blank" class="external">major sex scandal</a> which implicated others in the K-pop industry; it is not clear why that band member is not currently in prison.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Eyes, Nose, Lips</em> This song about lost love is not K-pop in the normal sense of happy &amp; bouncy but it is iconic. There are three different versions to see:
				<ol>
					<li>the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuGjlfXYM74" target="_blank" class="external">music video with English subtitles</a> and also Romanized Korean so you can sing along. Don't be surprised by the low number of views as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwuAPyOImoI" target="_blank" class="external"> actual music video</a> has a 174 million views at the time of writing. I gather this video was somewhat controversial at the time because he appears shirtless&mdash;but he has a great body! If the comments to the video are to believed, he is married to the woman he broke up with and then wrote this song for her.</li>
					<li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9un35OyWcN0" target="_blank" class="external">beautiful concert performance</a></li>
					<li>
						The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxMvQkcdPl8" target="_blank" class="external"> best duet ever</a>! Seriously, this is amazing. Even more incredible is that they only had an hour or so to practice before filming. Apparently the format of the show is that people send in video of them singing a famous song and when they get that idol on the show, they select from the best videos sent in and let them sing together. The young woman had been on another talent show before but that was her only previous exposure.

<h3>Weki Medi</h3>

			The girl in Astro's music video for <em>Breathless</em> is Yoo-jung and reading the comments I saw that she was a member of <strong>Weki Meki</strong>. At the time, they had released <em>Crush</em> which has this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT2AMc8hI6A" target="_blank" class="external">music video</a> but again, they are best seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzoZRUnk1Xc" target="_blank" class="external">dance practice</a>. Great song!

		<li>
			One of my all-time favorite K-pop songs! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9D6n-2afnM&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821758000">True valentine</a>(dance practice)
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DKU9GXibOU" target="_blank" class="external">Do whatever you want</a> (dance practice)</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTeOt6n90vM" target="_blank" class="external">Dazzle Dazzle</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is also worth mentioning that they are an 8-member group whereas almost all K-pop groups have an odd number of members. Having an odd number means that the person singing can be front and center with the other members symmetrically arranged on either side but with an even number they have to be more creative &ndash; which sometimes means hiding one member behind that person at the front and center.</p>

<h3>Cherry Bullet</h3>
<div class="story">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxTBkuo5YyA" target="_blank" class="external"> Really, Really</a> and also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NKp2BqdCQ" target="_blank" class="external">dance practice</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0It6vWbGOX0" target="_blank" class="external">Hands Up</a>. The group somehow lost three members and FNC Entertainment gave no explanation which naturally upset their fans. The entry for the company on Wikipedia claims that FNC stands for &ldquo;fish &apos;n&apos; cake&rdquo;: <em>The name is based on the miracle of feeding the multitude using only five loaves and the two fish. This is because Han Sung-ho is a devout Christian, he uses the name to hope for more miracles happen for the company.</em></li>

<h3>DIA</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>
		I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KGHiRo2apM" target="_blank" class="external"> Mr. Potter</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nx6lA6UzXQ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821759000">dance practice</a>.
	</p>
	<p>However I am baffled why they have produced so little material in the years since. In 2019 there was just a 5-song mini-album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIvRV38wWlk"  target="_blank" class="external">Newtro</a> &ndash; and one of those songs was an instrumental and the single <em>Woowa</em> failed to chart. The girls are presumably under contract and cannot leave to resume their studies or pursue other employment and MBK Entertainment is presumably still housing and feeding them &ndash; and I hope continuing to train them. There is a &ldquo;comebavck&rdquo; scheduled for 10<sup>th</sup> June 2020 so I hope whatever comes out is a hit.

	<p>Cuteness overload ahead! The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYumUDNryjw" target="_blank" class="external">Gwiyomi song</a>. How can this have just 167,000 views? To be fair, it is a derivative of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmByrwq0kDk" target="_blank" class="external">this</a>. They had more success with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L8FXg8zbDA" target="_blank" class="external">WiFi</a> a song that to me sounds similar to <strong>Momoland's hugely successful </strong><em>Bboom Bboom</em> (see below). By the time they arrived at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klwQKQTt7UM" target="_blank" class="external">Bbyong</a> they had lost 4 members and gained 2.</p>

	<p>I don't particularly like any of their songs that I know of but I am including them here because of them attempting their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7INrbDb68" target="_blank" class="external">dance routine while blindfolded</a>! </p>

<h3>&hellip;and so much more!</h3>
