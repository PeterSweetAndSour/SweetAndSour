	<p>When I was on the Global team at The Motley Fool we had a intern who had a list of &ldquo;My five favorite&hellip;&rdquo; on a range of topics including Korean pop music a.k.a. K-pop. I didn't care so much for the first, second and third but then <em>Cheer Up!</em> blew me away and I haven't looked back since! Thank you Chandler! There is so much great music coming out of Korea that it is hard to keep up with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why K-pop is different&mdash;and awesome</h2>
<div class="story">
	<p>There are a handful of big entertainment companies and a bunch of smaller ones that hold auditions for those who think they can be a star and in practice, this means 13, 14, 15-year olds. (Here is the information page for <a href="https://audition.jype.com/en" target="_blank" class="external">JYP Entertainment's auditions</a> for example. You can read in the original Korean if you wish though it is not strictly necessary to speak Korean.) Alternatively, one of the company scouts might <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/02/19/2018021901784.html" target="_blank" class="external">spot you while shopping</a>, think you have the look and personality they want and ask you to audition.</p>

	<p>As I understand it, if a child is selected then they leave regular school and move into the company dormitory and will then spend the next few <em>years</em> training more or less full-time in singing and dance. There are constant evaluations and some will drop out. Trainees must behave appropriately in public, are told what to eat, have very limited contact with their families, or anyone else in the outside world and are not allowed to date &ndash; the myth created is that K-pop stars are desirable but yet somehow &ldquo;available&rdquo;. Indeed, the agreements have been called <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-25/k-pop-s-gross-double-standard-women" target="_blank" class="external">slave contracts</a> and girls may be required to get cosmetic surgery!</p>

	<p>Then in their late teens they will be assigned, or compete for, a place in a group &ndash; all girls or all boys &ndash; and they will debut. By then, after years of practice they should be amazing&hellip; but they are the only visible part. The company employs/contracts song writers, musicians, choreographers, hair stylists, mark-up artists, fashion designers and video/sound producers and technicians to make a complete &ldquo;product&ldquo;.</p>
	
	<p>It is worth mentioning that the unblemished image created for K-pop idols means that the lyrics and the music vidoes are free from overt sexual overtones and as best I can tell from subtitles, no one swears. Performers and anyone else in the videos are fully clothed (though I will concede that skirts/dresses can be very short but they wear shorts for safety; it seems that even women showing belly buttons is a bit taboo in Korea). So, good clean fun.</p>

	<p>Hopefully the song is a hit and the trainee becomes a star (fans will adore them but they are merely company employees and the company takes the money) but that can bring its own set of pressures, sometimes with tragic consequences as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42393242" target="_blank" class="external">suicide of SHINee singer Jonghyun</a> demonstrates. More likely your catchy, beautifully executed song will get the interest of a small group of fans that will love it but most will never hear it and after a few years, the group will be disbanded. I make a point to listen to some of the lesser-known groups as some of their songs are as good as any and it is sad that they get so little recognition.</p>

	<p>Interestingly, K-pop has a known starting point in the way that <em>Rapper's Delight</em> is for hip hop. In April 1992, 3-member <strong>Seo Taiji &amp; Boys</strong> appeared on a talent show on MBC, one of Korea's TV networks performing a highly choreographed song that featured rapping. The judges were baffled and they came last. However the public loved it and the song was #1 in Korea for 17 weeks! The song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKK0UEu4Q5g" target="_blank" class="external">I know</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<div class="story">
	<p>If K-pop is completely new to you, I suggest that you start with the following, each of which are mentioned again below. Click the "CC" (closed captions) button on YouTube since many have English subtitles but perhaps surprisingly, they aren't necessary to enjoy!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A song from the world&apos;s most popular musical act:<br/>
			<?php setThumbnail("BoyWithLuv.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA", "figure--thumbnail-youtube"); ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			A song from, what was, the most popular girl group:<br />
			<?php setThumbnail("CheerUp.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7rCyll5AeY", "figure--thumbnail-youtube"); ?><br>
			(See <strong>BlackPink</strong> below for the currently most popular girl group.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Not really standard K-pop as it is a solo act with no dancing but it is beautiful (more explanation below):<br />
			<?php setThumbnail("EyesNoseLips.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9un35OyWcN0", "figure--thumbnail-youtube") ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			A fantastic song from a girl group that even K-pop fans probably know of only dimly, if at all. A great example of why you shouldn't limit yourself to just the most popular and also of a great, really cheap music video:</br>
			<?php setThumbnail("ThisIsMe.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhUmjANdQA", "figure--thumbnail-youtube") ?>
		</li>
		<li>
			Such a fun, bouncy song that tells a heart-warming story so you can't help smiling by the end! The music doesn't actually start until about 35 seconds in:<br />
			<?php setThumbnail("Hello.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNvBbh5jDcA", "figure--thumbnail-youtube") ?>

<h3>BTS</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>I have to mention boy band BTS first because if you have heard of any K-pop group, it was almost certainly BTS as they are huge. They are unusual in that they write a lot of their material</p>
	<p>James Cardin did a hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4x7sDevVTY" target="_blank" class="external">Carpool Karaoke with BTS</a>. Such a nice group of young men.</p>
	<ul>
		<li
			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA" target="_blank" class="external">Boy With Luv</a> (1.2 billion views as of 2021-05-22) I <strong>love</strong> their 2019 hit but that was the first song of theirs that I liked.</p>
			<p>	It is also well worth watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzvfbRbEjww" target="_blank" class="external">&ldquo;dance practice&rdquo; video</a> so you can see the whole performance start to finish. In fact, I often prefer the dance practice videos and the live performances to the music videos.</p>
			<p>Indeed there is a huge sub-genre of dance covers and &ldquo;KPop in public&rdquo; performances where dance groups from around the world reproduce, or reinterpret, songs from popular groups. For <em>Boy With Luv</em>, I encourage you to check these out:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6dRljmvGw" target="_blank" class="external"> 7 young men from Vietnam</a> (over 9 million views!)</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMDS5v4brj8" target="_blank" class="external">a rotating cast of dance groups</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TATGqCXMjj0" target="_blank" class="external"> 5 Korean(?) girls on top of a building</a></li>

			</ul>
			<p>&hellip;and so on.</p>
			<p>Oh, and a lovely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am3iJavzYi8" target="_blank" class="external">English-language cover</a> that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JewlhY8DGTI?t=329" target="_blank" class="external">BTS-approved</a>!
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg" target="_blank" class="external">Dynamite</a> The first video to hit 100m views on youtube in 24 hours and perhaps not coincidentally, their first song in English.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMweEpGlu_U" target="_blank" class="external">Butter</a> BTS broke their own record with this song reaching 113 million views in 24 hours! 
		</li>
	</ul>

	

	<p>Someone at my old office (Dilene) gave me this list of <em>her t</em>en favorite songs. See if you like them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMdTd9e-LEI">I need U</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eotYGFuLKXM" target="_blank" class="external"> Best of me</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc">Blood sweat &amp; tears</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs" target="_blank" class="external"> Boy in luv</a>
			Click on [CC] control to turn on subtitles. I found the lyrics disturbing, especially 
			<br /><em>&ldquo;Hold tight on to me/before I jump on you.&rdquo;</em>.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DwzBICPhdM" target="_blank" class="external">Not today</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		She told me that, &quot;These ones are less upbeat but beautiful&quot;:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8" target="_blank" class="external"> Spring Day</a></li>

		If there was a song in my head since mid-2015, it was probably one of theirs. They are wonderful! As with most K-pop, it is not serious music but it is so much fun! Three of the members are Japanese and one is from Taiwan which led to a 
			<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2016/01/21/twice-bitten">diplomatic incident</a>
		 with China in 2016. Their songs all have bits of English in them, especially in the chorus, which is good marketing since it is everyone&apos;s second language no matter where you are in Asia. I think all the official music videos have English subtitles too.

	<p>To the relief of fan&apos;s everywhere, all 9 members have signed a new contract as the original ends in October 2022 and there was speculation as to whether they would go their separate ways.</p>

Music groups with several years of success can either keep doing the same thing forever but that may get boring and they lose their audience&hellip; or they can try new musical directions but then they risk losing their audience. This is the single from the album <em>Taste of Love</em> and I've not listened to the other tracks yet. Will update this list soon.

It is just the sort of catchy, upbeat song that drew me to Twice in the beginning. Also pleasing to see is that Tzuyu appears to have found her self-confidence as in many videos she appears to shy from attention. She should feel confident given all that she has achieved, notably in this video, singing in English. As a bonus, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w495XsZ02vs" target="_blank" class="external">delightful video</a> of &ldquo;big sisters&rdquo; Momo and Nayeon seeing it for the first time.

				<li>hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwSG8viDbvI" target="_blank" class="external">&ldquo;random unit dance&rdquo;</a>, a variation on the &ldquo;relay dances&rdquo; that are often made in K-pop to make use of the vertical video format.

			2021-11-10 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwaXytZcgI" target="_blank" class="external">Scientist</a> A hypnotic song, I loved it from the first listen. As far as I know, this is the first time that Mina has been the opening singer. Some of the comments note that it is in a lower register and that Momo (starting at 2:04) is singing in her natural range and she has such a beautiful, sultry voice. This song is released as part of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOYH-CxtKI8&list=PLxA687tYuMWi_g7GaqOmRnO2rVZoOQbKE" target="_blank" class="external">Formula of Love</a> album.

				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUSqTW21Xl8" target="_blank" class="external">choreography video 1</a>, noteable becaues because Jeongyeon is in it. Like Mina before her, she's had to take time off because she was suffering anxiety attacks. At the end they show an earlier take where Tzuyu forgets the next move; I can feel her soul being crushed. She is the youngest in the group and I suspect that she rarely smiles in performances because she is concentrating so hard on getting her part right.</li>

This song, also from <em>Ready To Be</em>, <stong>instantly</stong> became one of my favorite Twice songs. When Jihyo starts singing at 0:55, I have visions of being knocked over by an ocean wave. There is no music video so I've linked to an unauthorized video where someone has provided translations and worked out who is singing which lines. JYP Entertainment has posted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk8hIPg2dNE" target="_blank" class="external">official version</a> with just a picture of the album cover.

			2023-07-27 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HddG4Yk9QYo" target="_blank" class="external">Bouquet (live)</a> from <strong>MiSaMo</strong>, the sub-unit of the Japanese members Mina, Sana and Momo. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64_lZErcOQ" target="_blank" class="external">music video </a> for the song was released on 2023-01-24 but at the time I did not really appreciate it whereas this version is just so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes when I heard it. All three of them are perfect in their own way but I am particularly proud of Momo who is primarily a dancer and normally forced to sing outside her natural range. If members had equal time on each song (they don't), she would normally have one-ninth of the singing but here it is one-third so I suspect she was out of her comfort zone. Her voice is instantly recognizable and here she it combines so well with Mina and Sana. <br /><br />They did five shows in Japan and at the end of this, the final concert, there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5hn776NxA0" target="_blank" class="external">a video of support messages</a> from the other members. While Sana and Momo are smiling, Mina appears overwhelmed with emotion. Obviously this was organized by JYPE but if the members don't truly love and care for each other, they are do an incredible job of faking it. <br /><br />Then MiSaMo were told that Nayeon was in the audience! At 13:12 Mina appears to be trying desperately not to cry (or possibly she is upset that Nayeon is stealing some attention) but I think the former.

	<p>On the 6th of July (2023), I went to the Twice concert at the Metlife stadium near New York! What fantastic evening with 50,000+ other screaming fans!! There was a lot of screaming. I've not been to a concert bigger than a few hundred for over 20 years so I had nothing to really compare it to but the members, the band, the set, the everything was perfect. I love them even more now. I pusted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cuh4xbzOdjB/?img_index=1" target="_blank" class="external">a few photos on Instagram</a> and uploaded a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzOUd0ecvus" target="_blank" class="external">Yes or yes, What is love & Cheer up</a>

<div class="story">
	<p>An earlier nine-member girl group who I&#39;m sure were the model for Twice. Indeed Girls Generation dressed up as flight attendants (twice!) and later Twice did the same which led to accusations of copying though <a href="https://hellosekaiiken.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/girls-generation-copies-passpo-who-copied-canary-club/" target="_blank" class="external">the idea was not new</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Weki_Meki">Weki Meki</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>My second favorite group after Twice!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The girl in Astro's music video for <em>Breathless</em> (below) is Yoo-jung and reading the comments I saw that she was a member of <strong>Weki Meki</strong>. At the time, they had released <em>Crush</em> which has this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT2AMc8hI6A" target="_blank" class="external">music video</a> but again, they are best seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzoZRUnk1Xc" target="_blank" class="external">dance practice</a>. Great song!
		</li>
		<li>
			One of my all-time favorite K-pop songs! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9D6n-2afnM&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590612821758000">True valentine</a> (dance practice)

		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHikmx0eVXM" target="_blank" class="external">Cool</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is also worth mentioning that they are an 8-member group whereas almost all K-pop groups have an odd number of members. Having an odd number means that the person singing can be front and center with the other members symmetrically arranged on either side but with an even number they have to be more creative &ndash; which sometimes means hiding one member behind that person at the front and center.</p>

<h3 id="Taeyang">Taeyang</h3>
<p class="subtitle">(From Big Bang.)</p>
<div class="story">
	<p>I believe <strong>Big Bang</strong> were the biggest K-pop group before BTS but I have yet to find any of their songs that I really like. Two of members have done significant solo work since but the band had to break up because the members had to do their military service.</p>
	<p>However, I have to mention that one of the other members, Seungri who was part owner of the Burning Sun nightclub, was in a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48702763" target="_blank" class="external">major sex scandal</a> which implicated others in the K-pop industry; it is not clear why that band member is not currently in prison.</p>

	<ul>

			<em>Eyes, Nose, Lips</em> This song about lost love is not K-pop in the normal sense of happy &amp; bouncy but it is iconic. One of my favorite songs ever in any genre, ever. There are three different versions to see:
				<ol>
					<li>the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuGjlfXYM74" target="_blank" class="external">music video with English subtitles</a> and also Romanized Korean so you can sing along. Don't be surprised by the low number of views as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwuAPyOImoI" target="_blank" class="external"> actual music video</a> has a 239 million views as of March 2023. I gather this video was somewhat controversial at the time because he appears shirtless&mdash;but he has a great body! If the comments to the video are to believed, he is married to the woman he broke up with and then wrote this song for her.</li>
					<li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9un35OyWcN0" target="_blank" class="external">beautiful concert performance</a></li>
					<li>
						The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxMvQkcdPl8" target="_blank" class="external"> best duet ever</a>! Seriously, this is amazing. Even more incredible is that they only had an hour or so to practice before filming. Apparently the format of the show is that people send in video of them singing a famous song and when they get that idol on the show, they select from the best videos sent in and let them sing together. The young woman had been on another talent show before but that was her only previous exposure.

<h3>BlackPink</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>I am not a big fan of BlackPink but I am including them here because they are <strong>so</strong> popular. I learned only in 2023 that Rosé was born in New Zealand and grew up in Australia. (Jennie lived in New Zealand for five years starting at age 9 and so is also comfortable in English. Lisa, from Thailand, speaks English too and having 3 English speakers gave them an edge in the global music business.)</p>
	
	<p>As of February 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs" target="_blank" class="external">DDU-DU DDU-DU</a> has 2.1 <em>billion</em> views! That puts them at #72 on the list of <a href="https://kworb.net/youtube/topvideos.html" target="_blank" class="external">most popular Youtube videos of all time</a>, ahead even of BTS (at #114). The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOJbXvjZ-cQ" target="_blank" class="external">dance practice video</a> has another 498 millin views!
	</p>
	<p>They released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioNng23DkIM" target="_blank" class="external">How you like that</a> on 2020-06-26 and it set a record on YouTube of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2020/06/29/blackpinks-new-music-video-officially-break-the-record-for-the-most-views-in-24-hours-on-youtube/#1c8b7429460d" target="_blank" class="external">86.3 million views in the first 24 hours</a>!

	</ul>
	<p>I was not paying attention to Red Velvet and I've probably missed some great songs but I was shocked to learn in May 2021 that Wendy fell 2.5m/8ft off a stage during a rehearsal on Christmas Day 2019 and sustained serious injuries. She was in hospital for 2 months and didn't reappear with the group until New Year's Day this year. Knowing this, it is sad to listen to two songs she released in April 2021:</p>

<h3>Alice, formerly Elris</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>Another management company took them over and then renamed them <strong>Alice</strong> which seems idiotic since you now can't search for them easily but I read something that said the Korean characters are better rendered as Alice in English and there was some legal problem with the old name. They released a song <em>Power of Love</em> which is quite different to their earlier work which seems a great way to lose the few fans they had. I feel sad for these girls as there is only so much the performers can do if their management is incompetant and/or underfunded.</p>

Originally a twelve-member group, Chuu was removed from the line-up on November 25, 2022, due to a contract dispute.</em>&rdquo; The concensus on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/z48d3r/blockberry_creative_kicks_chuu_from_loona/" target="_blank" class="external">K-pop Reddit</a> was that she was badly mistreated.</p>

In 2019 there was just a 5-song mini-album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIvRV38wWlk"  target="_blank" class="external">Newtro</a> &ndash; and one of those songs was an instrumental and the single <em>Woowa</em> failed to chart. The girls are presumably under contract and cannot leave to resume their studies or pursue other employment and MBK Entertainment is presumably still housing and feeding them &ndash; and I hope continuing to train them. They released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGaYUh782k4" target="_blank" class="external">Hug U</a> in mid-2020 but almost a year later, it has only 412,000 views. The final scene looks like they are taking one final photo before they disband. Maybe they have and can get on with their lives without being shackled to a mediocre entertainment company. [Oct 2022 update: They have disbanded and this is their final song - their management company couldn't even post it to Youtube with an English title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uYZEuA-mvE" target="_blank" class="external">Rooting For You</a>. </p>

	<p>Cuteness overload ahead! The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYumUDNryjw" target="_blank" class="external">Gwiyomi song</a>. How can this have just 167,000 views? To be fair, it is a derivative of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmByrwq0kDk" target="_blank" class="external">this</a>. They had more success with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L8FXg8zbDA" target="_blank" class="external">WiFi</a> a song that to me sounds similar to <strong>Momoland's hugely successful </strong><em>Bboom Bboom</em> (see below). By the time they arrived at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klwQKQTt7UM" target="_blank" class="external">Bbyong</a> they had lost 4 members and gained 2.</p>

	<p>I don't particularly like any of their songs that I know of but I am including them here because of them attempting their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7INrbDb68" target="_blank" class="external">dance routine while blindfolded</a>! </p>

	<p>The company behind them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_Entertainment" target="_blank" class="external">S.M. Entertainment</a>, is one the big four entertainment companies in South Korea so they can nurture their trainees, create high-quality videos and run effective promotion. This is apparently their first new girl group in 6 years so these 4 young women must be outstanding.</p>

<h3>KARA</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>This group has been around since 2007 with moderate success; I need to dig more into their back catalog. I was saddened to read that one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo_Hara" target="_blank" class="external">Goo Hara</a> committed suicide as a result of an abusive boyfriend. Her plight and subsequent trial drew attention to sex crimes against women in South Korea.</p>

<h3>S.E.S.</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p>This group is I think what is referred to as &ldquo;second-generation&rdquo; as they started back in 1997. They had a hit with the utterly hypnotic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uiR4SrDGZk" target="_blank" class="external">Dreams Come True</a> which was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69tJmsgd9I" target="_blank" class="external">reinterpretted by aespa</a> (see above) which as of 2023-03-19 is closing in on 100 million views. Amazingly the S.E.S. verion is a cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKK32ZB12bA" target="_blank" class="external">Rakastuin mä looseriin</a> (I fell in love with a loser) from <em>Finnish</em> duo Nylon Beat!

<div class="story">
	<p>I feel I've only scratched the surface and there are new songs and new groups coming out all the time.  Other groups I've come across - and this is just the girl groups: 
	A.O.A, APink, BerryGood, Bvndit, CLC, cignature, Dreamcatcher, DreamNote, Exid, Everglow, Fromis_9, f(x), 
Gugudan, Hwa Sa, I.O.I, Itzy (stablemate of Twice and successful partly because of it), I.Z. One, La Boum, Lovelyz, Orange Caramel, New Jeans, Pledis, Pristin, Purplebeck, UNI.T, WJSN (not to be confused with GWSN!).</p>
