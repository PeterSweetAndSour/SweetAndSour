They put out an extensive survey to learn how they could improve and implement recommendations. They have an accessible door opener, accessible seating, working elevators, and family-size gender neutral bathrooms for people with mobility deficits. They have ASL interpretation, closed captioning and other accommodations for people with hearing or cognitive disabilities. They have pay what you will performances to make sure that finances don't prevent people from attending. They also host monthly slam poetry events, a 20 year DC tradition. Woolly Mammoth helps me feel seen while also challenging me to be a better community member. DC would not be the same without them!&rdquo;</p>",
