Powered by a 354cc air-cooled engine with two cylinders and single overhead camshaft the car wore it''s motorcycle heritage on it''s sleeve. The engine was good for 31 hp at 8500 rpm with the 4 speed standard gearbox. Honda also offered a 3 speed automatic for those interested in such a convenience. The car was front wheel drive, which with the exception a few Citroens and Mini''s, was rather unusual at the time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The N 360''s styling was less than revolutionary a simple two-box design with two doors and a rather small trunk The 10" spare wheel/tire was put in the engine compartment as a safety feature. The new Honda looked like a hatchback but was not, just a plastic trunk lid. The hood was hinged at the windshield and had prop rod to hold it up. The hood was also the top of the fenders with bottom edge forming a straight contour line down the side of the vehicle. Overall the N 360 was 119 inches long with a 78.7 inch wheelbase, 45.3 inch track and weighed in at 1,114 pounds. Inside, the car had a simple interior, the doors featured vinyl panels that covered part of the door the rest was metal finished in the same color as the exterior. The front seats were individual bench type again covered in vinyl. The rear seat was simple bench type. The dash was flat and simple equipped with a speedometer, fuel gauge and radio. The heater relied on the little air-cooled engine and\r\nprovided barely adequate warmth in return. Unique features were interior door handles positioned in lower front corners of the doors and the thing most people are surprised by, the shifter came out of the lower portion of the dash instead of the floor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honda continued to improve the N360 by increasing engine displacement to include a 400cc option which of course changed that models name to the N400. The 400cc engine produced 33hp at 8000 rpm. The new N400 was available for sale in the Japan home market in October 1968. Less than one year later in May of 1969 the N 600 was offered to Japanese consumers. The 598cc engine made 45 hp at 7000 rpm. Other than adding larger engines the cars stayed basically the same. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 1969 an upgraded model was offered, the N 600G. The new variant featured fake wood on the dash, a tachometer and a console to absorb some of the vibration from the shift lever. The previously 2 spoke plastic steering wheel was replaced with sporty 3 spoke leather covered unit. There were also new door handles and front disc brakes and wow, carpet on the floor. The N 600G was only available to the Japanese and European markets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importation to America came in late 1969 as a 1970 model. The US got a more conventional looking dash with separate gauges and glovebox, and still sporting the shifter jutting from the dash. There was a floor shift option initially but it was dropped after a short while due to some safety concerns. There was no automatic transmission offered due to sluggish performance not suitable for America''s driving conditions. The car looked out of place on US highways that were still mostly populated by large 8 and 6 cylinder vehicles. Honda sold 3,770 N 600''s during the first year. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971 yet another new derivative was launched. The new Z600 Coupe feature all new bodywork. While still a 2 door it was much more curvaceous and featured a lift up rear window that looked like a scuba mask to most people. The hatchback also had new exterior mirrors and bumper overriders. Inside there was a new overhead console that featured separate map and dome lights, variations on this console carried on as option for first generation Civics. A new location to store the spare was added under the rear deck and had it''s own separate door accesible from the outside of the car. The Z 600 had the same engine and front wheel drive transmission that shared its oil with the engine. The new Coupe bore obvious styling similarities to the Civic that was about to hit US shores in 1973. Honda was rewarded for it''s new design with sales of near 10,000 cars with that number doubling for the 1972 model run. But of course Honda could not have forseen the success that new Civic would bring... </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our thanks go out to Jerry McDonald for developing this narrative for us:\r\nJerry can be reached at: mjm@bobo.ca.boeing.com (work) or jmac@nwrain.com (home)\r\nJerry also extends his thanks for helping to create this narrative to Frank Acevedo: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>franks50@gte.net  reachable at:<br>\r\nHonda Restoration<br>\r\nP.O.

It would have been heaps of fun even if not practical for taking groups on church camps.  I ended up getting a Ford Telstar (Maxda 626) that had been owned by the company I worked for.  I was taken for a ride in one and have to say it was very windy and noisy but when you are young, it is possible to overlook these points. Canvas tops were fitted as standard but a lockable fiberglass top was also available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Information originally from http://4wdonline.com/ClassicCars/Moke.html but they seemed to have moved on.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mini Moke was motoring at its most basic - a box-sided tray on wheels with a windscreen and the simplest of seats. In a warm climate it was great fun for taking down to the beach, a sort of four wheeled motorbike, but it was very draughty in the cold and wet with the "rag top" up and it did not offer much protection when mixing it with semi-trailers on the freeway. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moke was born in response to the British Army''s search for air-transportable vehicles. It was certainly light and compact, particularly with the windscreen down, but the front wheel drive, small wheels and low ground clearance cannot have given sufficient mobility, although experimental four-wheel-drive mokes were built - with two engines and transmissions, power at each end! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big military orders fell through but the Moke went on to become a cult, a real classic car. If buying a Moke: Mechanical parts are shared with the Mini and are quite readily available. The body will probably suffer from rust because of the limited weather proofing, and the vehicle may have been used on or near the beach, but it is of simple slab-sided construction and easy to work on. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>1960<br>\r\nAustin investigate a light weight minimalist vehicle suitable for air transport for the British Army. </p>\r\n<p>1963<br>\r\nMini Moke prototype built but the Army abandons interest. </p>\r\n<p>1964 August<br>\r\nCivilian Mini Moke released, based on the front wheel drive Minicar with an 850cc engine transversely mounted. </p>\r\n<p>1966<br>\r\nMoke production transferred to Australia. </p>\r\n<p>1968<br>\r\nLarger 13" wheels raise ground clearance to 8", 1100c engine fitted. </p>\r\n<p>1972<br>\r\nCalifornian Mokes produced with 1275cc motor for the US market. </p>\r\n<p>1981<br>\r\nNovember, Leyland Australia stops building Mokes but production is transferred to Portugal. </p>\r\n<p>1992<br>\r\nMoke production stops in Portugal.

I took it back and had them diagnose the problem and they said it would cost $213 so I gave them approval to do it. Then when I went to get the car they said something else had to be replaced so the bill was $333 making a total of $520.  Had I known it would cost this much, we would have given it away and bought something else.  Now we are stuck with it a little longer.  It really needs a new engine as it now blows smoke when you start it but even if that was fixed, it still has no air conditioner, a huge crack in the windscreen and needs new gas struts to hold up the rear hatch.

They checked the meters of all our neighbors to see if the meter was still turning over when everything in the house was shut off and found no problems. They did chemical tests 3 times looking for chlorine and fluorine which is in city water but not rain water and the first test suggested it might be city water but the second and third were negative. We even paid for an independent test but that was negative too. An important caveat to the chemical tests though is that even if water is left standing in a bucket, chlorine (and fluorine?) dissipate quickly but once in contact with the soil, all bets are off. </p>\r\n<p>Even though the water was perfectly clear, I considered the possibility of a broken sewer pipe since dirt makes an excellent filter and so wondered if testing for biological matter might prove it but we were told that soil is so full of it anyway that testing was useless. Unlike water supply pipes, sewer lines are not under pressure so any leaks are likely to be limited. </p>\r\n<p>The DC government web site has an <a href="http://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis_allservices/viewer.htm" title="Atlas All-in-One" class="external" target="_blank">online mapping service</a> with all sorts of data layers such as historical maps, land use, floor plains and so on but what I cared about was elevation. I created a <a href="../files/Elevations.pdf" title="Document with maps of elevations" target="_blank">document showing elevations around us</a>. It is quite clear that the only higher ground is a few blocks to the north-west of us but there is nothing in the surface topology that suggests it would get funneled toward us.</p>\r\n<p>We reluctantly concluded that either the subsoil conditions direct water towards us or possibly that there are broken pipes under the adjacent school since their water use might be high enough to mask a significant loss so we had to plan for water always being present. (Having now lived here during the school holidays, I think we can rule out the school being the problem as the pumps kept going.)</p>\r\n<p>The builder agreed to proceed if we paid an extra $11,000 to cover deeper excavation to allow a gravel bed under the basement concrete slab to be increased from 4"/10cm to 12"/30cm and deeper foundation underpinning. We also paid $600 to a geotechnical engineer to take a look and make recommendations which was a single sketch, no doubt recycled from many previous projects. </p>\r\n<p>Lan''''s  brother-in-law who is a civil engineer and has experience in such things also sent us instructions and drawings on how to handle the underpinning and drainage which I redid on the computer for clarity (see <a href="../files/TomsExcavationRecommendations.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Underpinning and drainage instructions">instructions</a>, <a href="../files/TomsSketch1.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Sketch 1">diagram 1</a>, <a href="../files/TomsSketch2.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Sketch 2">diagram 2</a>.
