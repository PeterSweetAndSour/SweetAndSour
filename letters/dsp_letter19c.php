<h2>In sickness and in health</h2>
<div class="story">
	<p>Lan has suffered this year from <em>adhesive capsulitis</em>, more commonly known as a &ldquo;frozen shoulder&rdquo;&mdash;as she did before we came to America. We hoped that physio-therapy and time would heal but after a year of discomfort, she went under anesthetic last week to be manipulated. She has regained significant movement but she is still in pain and little strength.</p>
	<p>I found out this year that my stomach valve doesn&apos;t close properly causing acid to eat away at my esophagus. I share this mainly because, with the benefit of hindsight, this hereditary condition is probably what led to my father being stricken with esophageal cancer and dying so young. I will have to take pills for the rest of my life to calm it down or surgery is possible.</p>

		Now that I&apos;m in my mid-40s, there are several options allowing me to deny to myself that I&apos;m getting older. I could have bought a red sports car for instance but being cheap, I elected to run a marathon instead. The mere fact that 26.2 miles or 42km is three times as far as I&apos;d ever run was not going to stop me. I actually attempted training last year but soon had to give up after hurting both feet. I found out that shoes were my problem, not just the particular running shoes but shoes in general.<sup><a href="#Note9">Note&nbsp;9</a></sup>  I switched to bare feet initially and then to &ldquo;gloves&rdquo; for my feet<sup><a href="#Note10">Note&nbsp;10</a></sup>  and that corrected my running style. I was thrilled with my time of 3:51:47.
