			<h2>Window frames</h2>
			<div class="story">
				<p>These photos show some of the badly degraded trim on the outside of the window frames that need to be replaced. We believe they should <strong><em>all</em></strong> be replaced. First, the back bedroom, north window. The bottom has completely rotted away.</p>

				<p>Middle bedroom window</p>

				<p>Dining area window. We have spoken about the timber on the bottom which you said will be replaced when the window sill is replaced but the timber on either side is in poor condition too.</p>
				<img src="photos/DiningAreaWindow.jpg" /> 
				
				<p>We were also greatly concerned that timber on the inside of many of the windows is seriously degraded and while know this will be covered over, it seems these should have been replaced. This should have been done <i> before</i> the windows were sealed in. Here is a sample:</p>

				<p>These all look quite battered and it is hard to see that they are worth saving.</p>
