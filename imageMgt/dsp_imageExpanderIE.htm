<body>
	  <p>It appears that you are using a recent version of Internet Explorer, in which case,
	  the browser may have been &quot;helpful&quot; by shrinking the map to fit inside
	  the window. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to read the names of the towns at this
	  scale. </p>
	  <p>Click on the map to make it the active window then hold your mouse over the map for 
	  a few seconds and you should see this:</p>
	  <img src="imageExpanderIE.gif" width="43" height="44">
	  <p>Click on the &quot;image expander button&quot; to force Internet Explorer to show
	  graphic at full size.</p>
	  <p><a href="javascript:window.close()">Close</a></p>
