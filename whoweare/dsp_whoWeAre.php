	<p>For those who don't know us, we are Australians and both of us are now computer programmers living in Alexandria, Virginia (America).</p>
	<p>Here is the more detailed version:</p>
	<p>I (Peter) was born in England but lived in Australia most of my life and most of that time was in Sydney.  I did a Mechanical Engineering degree and got steady jobs but by 1991, the recession "we had to have" was forcing my employer to lay-off staff.  I was worried so I got the first job I could and that was as a technical writer producing operation and maintenance manuals for machinery.  Eventually, I was to get back to being an engineer but in 1998 when the US government would not let me work, I did a course in Internet Development. I then had a job for over three years with Premier Data Services but was laid off in March 2003.</p>
	<p>Lan was born in Vietnam into a big family.  A very big family.  She is the oldest of 11 children!  There was a war on and in 1975 Saigon fell to the communists.  Times were hard, so in 1981 she risked her life by getting on a tiny boat with 35 others and they drifted into the South China Sea.  Fortunately, they were picked up by a ship and taken to a camp in Singapore before the Australian government brought her Sydney.</p>
	<p>She spoke no English when she arrived but worked at two jobs and studied, sending money and food packages home.  In 1983 she bought a townhouse and became an Australian citizen.  She completed her Data Processing Certificate and later, the Bachelor of Business degree majoring in Computing.  She is a clever girl but it was 95% hard work that got her through.</p>
	<p>In 1989, I bought the townhouse next door to Lan and we got to know each other.  We became friends.  We got married in 1991.</p>
	<p>There are only two rules in our household:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The wife is ALWAYS right.</li>
		<li>If the wife is wrong, refer to rule 1.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="endText">We bought a house and lived there during 1994 but then Lan was offered a job in America and we arrived in March 1995.  Everything since then is detailed in our newletters - see <a href="../letters/index.php">Coming to America</a>.</p>
