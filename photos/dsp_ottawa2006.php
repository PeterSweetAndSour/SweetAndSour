<h2>Ottawa, 7, 8 Oct 06</h2>
<div class="story noSpaceBelow">
   <p>Ottawa Ontario is, of course, Canada&rsquo;s capital city. It was added to our itinerary almost as an afterthought when I realized it was much closer to Montreal than to Toronto as I had assumed, so it made sense to do it on this trip. However, with only Saturday afternoon and Sunday to spend in the city, we were only able to see the main government buildings in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Hill" target="_blank" class="external">Parliament Hill</a> district and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Museum_of_Civilization" target="_blank" class="external">Museum of Civilization</a>, Canada&rsquo;s most visited museum which is actually across the river in Hull, Quebec.</p>
