<h2>Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 16 Aug 2009</h2>
<div class="story noSpaceBelow">
   <p>This trip was mainly about Maine but our first stop was in Portsmouth which was pleasant though it would
	have been nicer if it wasn't so hot, a problem that was to continue most of the week and was quite unexpected.</p>
	<p>Our camera was having problems before we left but I thought I'd fixed it by cleaning the battery terminals.
	I hadn't and it died almost immediately so all but a half-dozen pictures were taken with my mobile phone which means
	the color is a bit weird sometimes and since there is no zoom, some objects of interest are still in the distance. Sorry.</p>
