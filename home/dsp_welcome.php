<div class="story">
	<p>The site has been updated to work with phones, something I should have fixed a decade ago and I have added two new pages of content:</p>

		<li><a href="<?= $rootRelativeUrl ?>artsandculture/kpop">K-pop!</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>I also added some notes about the update on <a href="<?= $rootRelativeUrl ?>technology/thisWebSite">This web site</a> and included the two &ldquo;Update from Portugal&rdquo; emails I sent with links to the respective photosets as <a href="<?= $rootRelativeUrl ?>letters/letter20">letter 20</a>  and <a href="<?= $rootRelativeUrl ?>letters/letter21">letter&nbsp;21</a> under Newsletters. However, the most time-consuming part of the project was modernizing all the code and modifying an existing image gallery to allow long captions.</p>

<div class="story">
	<p>Not something to celebrate in the normal sense but I had a crash while riding my bike to work which put in me in hospital for 2&half; days and then I was off work for a month recovering. It also left me completely deaf in my right ear.</p>
	<p>What is worth celebrating, and is indeed quite humbling, is the <em>extraordinary</em> efforts my coworkers and neighbors went to to find me when I failed to show up at work at the normal time. Thank you. You know who you are. <a href="./images/WhereIsPeter.png" target="_blank">See the whole discussion</a> on our office communications system (last names are removed).

I managed 59:xx twice in my late teens but those times were not directly comparable since that was before timing chips so it was time from the gun but in both cases I think I was fairly close to the front and so it would have been just a minute or two to cross the start line.</p>

	<p>Two years since I last posted anything! Goodness. Since then we finished the main work on the house and been on trips together to The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark then to the UK by plane and back across the Atlantic by ship. Lan has taken separate trips to Iceland and London, Paris &amp; Lyon. I failed in my effort to ride a bike to New York in a weekend but did make it to <a class="external" href="https://goo.gl/photos/WSuWmdcHGDU6neNZA" target="_blank">Delaware</a>. I ran the 2013 Marine Corps Marathon in 3:14:40 (last year I ran injured and so was thrilled to manage 3:33:33) and will go to Australia shortly.</p>

	<p>I've added some <a href="<?= $rootRelativeUrl ?>timeforjustice/callsForJustice">letters calling for peace and justice</a> in the Middle East.

<div class="story">
	<p>Presidential Inaugurations only come around once every four years and this one, more than any other, was the one we wanted to be part of. However, the 20th January date means winter and the week before was <em>bitterly</em> cold. After arriving home on the previous Thursday when it was uncomfortable to be outside for more than 10 minutes, I told Lan I couldn't and wouldn't stand on the Mall for several hours to watch a ceremony and speech that was going to be broadcast on television. Fortunately it warmed up somewhat so the maximum temperature expected that day was 0&deg;C/32&deg;F and our neighbor expressed an interest in going.</p>
	<p>We went, we eventually got on a train and then another train, we walked and we walked, we found a spot and we waited. We were cold but glad we did it. </p>

	<p>I ran the Marine Corp Marathon and was thrilled to finish with a time of 3:51:47! Well, I ran most of they way&mdash;I'm a big believer in walking breaks to rest up a little and I took the photo at right during an early stop with a disposable camera.</p>
	<p>You might be amused by my footwear: Vibram Five Fingers <a href="http://vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_Sprint_m.cfm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Vibram Five Fingers">Sprint</a>! To me there is convincing evidence that running shoes encourage the non-elite runner to a adopt a bad technique which ultimately results in injuries. Of course Nike and the other shoe companies don't want you to think this way. Their solution to injury avoidance is ever more sophisticated and expensive shoes. Ideally we'd run barefoot but this is the next best thing though you have to build up gradually since, unlike the Kenyans and Ethiopians who ran 5 miles barefoot to school each day, the muscles and ligaments inside our feet are weak and the soles of our feet are soft.
