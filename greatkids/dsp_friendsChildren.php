<h3>Scott and Todd</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p class="endText">Scott (turned 4 in March 2000) and Todd (turned 2 in April 2000) belong to Mark, a friend of mine from church and also a mechanical engineer, and his wife Brenda.  I've enjoyed playing with Scott and going out to help buy sand for his sand pit.  It seems Scott enjoyed playing with me too but he enjoyed playing with Lan even more.  A mutual friend of ours A-<b>lan</b>-na came to visit Brenda and Mark and it seems Scott was heart-broken to discover it wasn't Lan coming over to play.  The names do sound similar, especially if you are three.  Lan and I don't really know Todd yet; he's very little.</p>

<h3>Elizabeth and Sarah</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Elizabeth (turned 3 in April 2000) and Sarah (born Jan 2000) belong to a couple like us - Richard is western and Lily is Asian.  It will be interesting to see how they grow up as some girls of mixed ancestry are really beautiful.  Leaving that aside, we already know that Elizabeth (also known as "Winkie") is very smart & very funny.  As of January, she also has a sister Sarah.</p>
   <p>Like a lot of kids, Elizabeth pretends to answer the telephone and has her own "phone".  One day, she discovered a computer mouse and you have to admit that it is approximately the correct size and has a cord coming out of it.  She amused herself and us by answering the mouse, not knowing the difference!</p>
   <p>By the time I left in November 1998, Winkie was 21 months old and she could already tell you the main body parts like "leg" and "hand" if you pointed to them.</p>
   <p class="endText">An amazing incident happened in March this 1998.  The family came over for dinner at my house in late-October and Winkie found my rainbow-colored "feather" duster which was essentially new and therefore clean and very bright.  She thought it was a lot of fun to run around the house waving it.   I left the feather duster over at their house since I thought Winkie might get some enjoyment out of it and if she didn't, her parents could always use it as a duster.  She found it again in early March, then 3Â½ months since I last saw her.  She held it up in the air and proclaimed "Peter".</p>

<h3>Celine (8) & Sophie (6)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>These girls belonging to a family in Minnesota are just gorgeous and are the best readers for their age that we have met.  Celine read Too much TV to us which was delightful.</p>
   <p>Their father works for the same company that I used to and they kindly invited me over for dinner a few times when I had to visit the head office.  On one visit I was able to take Lan along with me and we had a wonderful evening together.</p>
   <p class="endText">Lan thought we should bring something when we went to dinner and as well as some fruit (boring) and three blocks of chocolate of different types.  While mum and dad were out of the room, little Sophie started on one of the blocks and was on her fourth piece when she said, <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold; color:blue">"We like mint, don't we?"</span>.  There seemed a lot of emphasis on the last part and it seemed that we were expected to agree with her decision of which one to open.  We could barely contain our laughter.  While we don't condone such behaviour, you have to admire her for her skills in using the language at just four.</p>

<h3>Anthea (turned 2 in November 2000)</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p class="endText">We know the parents of this little girl but she was born when we were here, so we'll have to get to know her later.  While her father is essentially non-musical (like Peter), her mother is a talent celloist and so her mother's sisters are professional musicians.  Fortunately the musical genes have been passed on - at one point she would only drink her milk if Neil Diamond's Cracklin' Rose was playing!  What good taste.</p>

<h3>Jake (4)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Jake belongs to Glen, who worked with Lan at US West Dex, and his wife Maxine.  They are Australians who came to work in the US on the same type of visa we had.</p>
   <p class="endText">Lan and I had the priviledge of going to Jake's third birthday as the only guests.  Poor Jake was sick and so in the interest of not infecting any of his young friends, the party was cancelled but someone had to sing him Happy birthday and watch him blow out the candles.  Lan claims that Jake likes being kissed on the hand.</p>
