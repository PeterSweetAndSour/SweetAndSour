   <p><b>This is of historical interst only as it is years out of date.</b> <br />The older children are now out of school and on the roads!</p>
   <p>You may have realized that we don't have any children of our own and hopefully it will stay that way.  However, there are plenty that are really special to us.</p>

<h3>Patricia (9)</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p class="endText">We spent a few days over New Year's day 1999 at her parents house in Whittier (Los Angeles), California and we really enjoyed getting to know this lovely girl.  So friendly and polite.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to take her out for a whole day but we did stay back in LA past our schedule so we could at least take her out for an ice cream.  As we were leaving the next morning Lan said we would be back to visit one day and she smiled, waved and shouted <i>"I'm counting"</i>. How sweet.</p>

<h3>Nam (12) & Phi (7)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>These boys belong to Lan's brother Phuong and his wife.  Nam is a wonderful boy and as you can see from the photo, he is growing up to be quite handsome.  If he can learn to play guitar, I suspect he will later have to fight girls off with pointed sticks!  We are all proud of him for doing well in the exam to get him into a selective school.</p>
   <p>Australian readers will be amused to know that when Nam's fourth birthday was approaching, he asked Lan is she would like to <i>"come to his Barbeque Galore"</i>!</p>
   <p>I haven't had all that much of a chance to get to know Phi as we have been in the US for most of his life.  He has given us the word <i>"exceller!"</i>, meaning excellent.  As a five year old, I think even more  a bundle of energy than most.  He certainly wore me out.</p>
   <p class="endText">Nam is now old enough to get a driver's licence.  Definitely no longer a "kid" but a young man.</p>

<h3>Viet (11) & Catherine (7)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>I got to know Viet more than the rest of Lan's nieces and nephews as we spent quite a bit of time with Lan's sister Le and her husband Lun in the few years after we got married.  At that time, neither of his parents spoke English well and naturally, Vietnamese was spoken at home.  It was fascinating to see how Viet learnt so much English just by watching TV though there were a few hilarious mistakes such as <i>"Oh my dog!"</i>.  He has also given us the word <i>"tiger"</i> to mean tired and Lan and I used that every few days.</p>
   <p>We "borrowed" him for one evening in 1991, not all that long after we got married and we took him to church.  He was so well behaved though the boring parts (just from the beginning through to the end) and then afterwards charmed everyone who saw him asking <i>"Where's the party?  Where's the party?"</i>.  We were a very proud aunt and uncle.</p>
   <p>Viet is now in his last year of primary (elementary) school and has done exceptionally well in some state-wide maths competition.  A really nice boy.  Mind you, he taught Lan and I the engaging rhyme <i>"Roses are red, violets are blue; the back of a bus, reminds me of you"</i>!</p>
   <p class="endText">While I was in Sydney in 1998, Le took pity on me many times and had me over for dinner which gave me an opportunity to get to know Catherine, or Nhi by her Vietnamese name.  She's a doll as you can see from the photos.  I was even invited to her 6th birthday party and that was a thrill, though she was sick that day and couldn't say very much.</p>

<h3>Hoang Anh (12) & Anthony (6)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Hoang Anh is perhaps the sweetest girl I know and she's been that way for a long time.  She came to Sydney when she was about 4 and I was in a room with her and several other Vietnamese children and they were all chattering away in Vietnamese.  I had no idea she spoke any English until she came over to me and told me in slow but perfect English <i>"I go to pre-school on Monday"</i>.  It melted my heart, and Lan's too.</p>
   <p>Lan and I visited Adelaide in 1998 and we took a group to the zoo.  One of Lan's nephews is only 2 and can't walk around a whole zoo so Hoang Anh took it upon herself to look after the little boy and she carried him on her back for most of the afternoon.  So loving and we love her for that.  Lan tells me she also plays the piano beautifully.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, I didn't have much chance to get to know Anthony as we were in Adelaide only 2&half; days and the only time with Anthony was when there were lots of people around so I couldn't spend much time with him individually.  He seems like a good kid from what I can tell.  If he is half as nice as his sister he'll be doing well.</p>
   <p class="endText">2003 update: we have been privileged to have had regular email contact with Anh during the last year or two.  Email is a wonderful thing so we can stay in touch even though we are far away.</p>

<h3>Ngoc (11) & Chau (9)</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p class="endText">These beautiful girls came to our wedding in 1991 with their father, Lan's brother Phu and his wife Duyen, but they were tiny and we were busy so I really didn't get to know them until our 2Â½ day visit to Adelaide last year.  Lan and I took them and Hoang Anh out after school for a drive to the sea, a walk around the waterfront, an ice cream and a play in a playground.  Heaps of fun.  I wish we could borrow them for a few days so we could spend some more time with them.</p>

<h3>Samual (5)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>Belongs to Lan's sister Nhung and her husband Toi.  He is really cute to see and really friendly to me.  He is very thoughtful child to his grandparents and tidy too.  Since he is an only child, he loves to be with his cousins, aunties and uncles.</p>
   <p class="endText">2003 update: Samual now has email and internet access at home so we look forward to keeping in better contact with him.</p>

<h3>Susan (13) & Julie (7)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>The girls belong to Lan's sister Lien and her husband.  They live on the east coast which is a long, long way from here so I've seen them only once in America and that was 4 years ago.  Lan went to visit in March and had a great day with them at a water park and they planted a garden together.  Sounds like lots of fun; I wish I had been there.</p>
   <p>Lan said Susan was really helpful with another nephew belonging to another of Lan's sisters.  She is a really polite young lady on the phone.</p>
   <p class="endText">The two girls and their mother did come out to Australia last year and Lan timed her visit to coincide with the time they were in Sydney.  There were huge gatherings at Le's house and lots of noise but I did have a bit of chance to get to know the girls and they are fun. </p>

<h3>Thinh (5) & Khang (3)</h3>
<div class="story">
	<p class="endText">These boys belong to Lan's brother who was living with Lan when the two of us met in Sydney.</p>

<h3>Eleanor (5) and Charlotte (2)</h3>
<div class="story">
   <p>(Ages correct for May 2003)</p>
   <p>My sister's and brother-in-law's daughters.  Eleanor is now an international jet-setter having moved from Australia to England and been to various European destinations.  Refers to aeroplanes as "up-there".</p>
   <p>Joined by younger sister Charlotte in October 2000, just days before aunty Lan came to visit.  When we arranged the visit, I thought Charlotte was due about 10 days before Lan arrived but that turned out not to be the case. If Lan had been a day or two earlier, she would have had to go to the hospital instead.</p>
   <p class="endText">2003 update: The family moved back to Australia in 2002 and Eleanor has started school at the same school her mother (i.e. my sister) went to.</p>
