Dear Mr. President,

I am aghast to see in the Washington Post today (https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/) that you are sending yet more weapons to Israel to kill yet more Palestinians. Is 32,000 not enough?

You and your administration keep saying that Israel has a right to defend itself but apparently you don't recognize that the Palestinians they are fighting were pushed into Gaza as a result of ETHNIC CLEANSING in 1948 and you deny Palestinians the right to defend themselves against their oppressors. If the war in 1948 had gone the other way and it was Jews inside Gaza, would you send arms to an Arab Palestinian government to kill them? Of course not.

It has been demonstrated over and over that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza. It is way past the time when America should be leading an arms embargo against Israel, applying financial sanctions and travel bans against its leaders and if you are sincere about a two-state solution, recognize the Palestinian state on the 1948 partition plan borders and require that all the Jewish "settlers" exit the Palestinian lands. 

You are now complicit in Israeli war crimes but there is still an opportunity to salvage something for your reputation in history. I hope you take it.
