Re: Israel/Palestine

Please terminate all aid to Israel and immediately recognize a Palestinian state. 

The current conflict is a direct result of the ethnic cleansing of Arab inhabitants from the land that now makes up modern Israel. Virtually everyone in Gaza is a descendant of those that fled the violence and that Israel never permitted to return and in the 75 years since, they have never been shown dignity by the Israelis, nor do they have the right to vote in Israeli elections and so have no political voice. By denying all non-violent ways to address their legitimate grievances, the only remaining option is violence. Enough is enough. I believe we have given Israel $150 billion since they proclaimed independence. So

1. Terminate any further aid to Israel as this may force them to be more reasonable.
2. Recognize a Palestinian state and place the American embassy in East Jerusalem
3. Demand that Israel withdraw ALL settlers from the West Bank.
4. If we can't do 2 and 3 above, demand a one-state solution i.e. demand that Israel recognize everyone in the occupied territories as Israeli citizens with the right to vote.

The madness has to stop and only justice will allow that to happen. Thank you.
