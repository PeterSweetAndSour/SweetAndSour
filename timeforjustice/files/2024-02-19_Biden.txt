Dear Mr. President,

Re: Gaza

By continuing to supply weapons and diplomatic cover, you and your administration are now complicit in the on-going massacre in Gaza, not to mention making somewhere between one and two MILLION people homeless. 

Israel has used the October 7th attacks as a pretext to destroy Gaza in the hope that the population will leave. 

You must be aware that virtually everyone in Gaza is there because of the ETHNIC CLEANSING of the Arab population from most of what is now Israel in 1948 and in many cases, bulldozed their villages so that there was nothing to return to. It is happening all over again... made possible because of America's blind support, no matter how many human rights abuses they commit.

I urge you to:
1. Immediately suspend all aid to Israel
2. Immediately resume funding UNRWA - even if Israel's allegations are true, the UNRWA staff were not carrying out the organization's policies but acting as private individuals. In any case, I am extremely suspicious that the dossier was created to distract media attention from the genocide case before the UN.
3. Demand that Israel allow foreign journalists into Gaza. If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.
4. Recognize a Palestinian state and set up an embassy in East Jeruselum
5. Explain to the American people what happened in 1948 and point out that if the war back then had gone the other way and the population of Gaza was Jewish, there is no way that we would support an Arab Palestinian government doing to the Jews what the Israelis are now doing to the Palestinians.

Sincerely,
Peter
