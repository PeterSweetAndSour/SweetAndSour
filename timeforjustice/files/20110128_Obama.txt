Dear Mr President, 

Please tell Mr Mubarak to step down! 

We say we support freedom and democracy and indeed you spoke eloquently about this in Cairo just two years ago, yet we support dictators such as the Mubarak who allow neither. Withdrawing support for him and other Presidents-for-life around the world would win the U.S. tremendous respect and make it somewhat less likely that the populations suffering in those societies will want to attack us. 

Supporting dictators over the people they oppress often causes us tremendous problems when they are finally overthrown as we've seen in Iran after the Shah was forced out in 1979. Stability must not be bought at the expense of the people under the control of corrupt rulers.

Please act quickly and forcefully.

Thank you.
