Dear Mr Vice President,

Thank you for FINALLY standing up to the Israelis and telling them bluntly that the so-called settlements are the problem that is preventing a lasting peace. It angers me that the US gives so much aid to Israel but its officials are so spineless in confronting their greed and aggression. They actively dispossess the Palestinian people, then when they attempt to defend themselves, the Palestinians are branded "terrorists" and overwhelming violence is used against them.

As Palestinian lawyer Michael Tarasi recently noted, "We are negotiating the division of a pizza, and in the meantime Israel is eating the pizza"! The annexation of Palestinian land and the eviction of Palestinian residents, followed by the influx of Jewish settlers is nothing less than ethnic cleansing.

Please demand a PERMANENT FREEZE on settlement construction, not the phony 10-month pause which certainly doesn't fool the Palestinians. That must also exclude the "natural growth" loop hole the Israelis try to use. In fact, as I'm sure you know, every settlement is illegal under the 4th Geneva Convention and so, we should be demanding that all, and I mean all, the settlers leave the West Bank and the Golan Heights. 

Sincerely,


Peter Varley
