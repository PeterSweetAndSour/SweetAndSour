Dear Mr. President,

I was thrilled when you were elected to get rid of Mr Trump and his... well, everything. It has been a great relief that sanity has returned to government, particularly on the issue of COVID-19.

However, I am so disappointed by your response to the latest fighting in Israel/Palestine! The statement issued after your call to the Israeli Prime Minister, says "The President reiterated his firm support for Israelâ€™s right to defend itself..." 

Palestinians also have a right to self-defense! America has long said that it supports a 2-state solution but the billions of dollars of military aid we give to Israel each year (paid for in part by the taxes I pay), are used in part to make sure that that never happens. 

As usual, Israel's response to Palestinians attacks is utterly disproportionate as the casualty figures show. By sending weapons and giving diplomatic cover for Israel at the United Nations, America is complicit in Israel's ongoing dispossession of, and violence against, Palestinians that has been going on since before the founding of Israel in 1948.

A political, not military, solution is needed but until America applies pressure to Israel, there will see no incentive for Israel to make one. As Mao said, "Power comes from the barrel of a gun", and we send them a lot of guns, or their equivalents. 

Instead of sending weapons, America should be implementing sanctions against Israel for its appalling human rights record against Palestinians as recent reports from Human Rights Watch and BT'Salem document.

At the very least:
1. Demand an immediate ceasefire.
2. Stop any further US arms transfers to Israel until they provide guarantees that they will meet the same standards of not using those weapons against civilians that I believe we require of other countries.
3. Demand the immediate end of construction of Jewish "settlements". Under the Geneva Conventions, every single settlement in the West Bank is there illegally. 

It is a start. Thanks

Although not stated, the Contact page on WhiteHouse.gov limits you to 2000 characters. This is what I intended but I had to truncate my letter:

3. Demand the immediate end of construction of Jewish "settlements". Under the Geneva Conventions, every single settlement in the West Bank is there illegally. The continued growth of the settlements since the Oslo Accords of the 1990s provides compelling evidence to Palestinians that the Israelis are doing everything they can to entrench themselves and make it impossible to create a Palestinian state.
4. End the tax-exempt status of organizations that take donations from Americans to buy land from impoverished Palestinians - impoverished because Israel's effective military occupation of the West Bank - and control of the water supply - cripples economic development.

More needs to be done for any hope of a last peace but that is a start. Thank you.
