In the broadcast this evening, Katie mentioned she will be interviewing Israeli PM Netenyahu tomorrow. Please don't let this be yet another Israeli public relations offensive where no hard questions are asked. I suggest you ask:

1. You continually draw attention to Iran's alleged nuclear program but you have never declared your own or joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Will you let international inspectors into the facility at Dimona?

2. The blockade of Gaza was supposed to prevent weapons being smuggled in. If that is the case, why have crayons, pasta and hair shampoo amongst other civilian items been blocked in the past? Also, why does Israel block the export of goods from Gaza since that would promote economic growth and reduce tensions.

3. Why should the Palestinians believe that Israel is serious about peace when "settlements" continue to be built in the West Bank? A 10-month pause was announced. Why won't you make it permanent?

Thanks. Please do some real journalism.
