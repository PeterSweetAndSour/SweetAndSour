Dear Mr. President,

Re: Gaza

I am outraged that the US blocked a UN resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire. The Israelis have now killed at least 10 (!) times as many Palestinians as Israelis were killed on October 7th.

A ceasefire is not enough though as the majority of Gaza's population has now been forced from their homes and is living without reliable access to food, water and shelter. Massive aid needs to be delivered immediately.

Even if every member of Hamas is killed and the hostages are rescued, the conflict will not end until the legitimate grievances of Palestinians are addressed. 

Ultimately these have their roots in the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Arabs from the land they occupied inside what is now Israel and then crucially, Israel's refusal to allow them to return home when the fighting ended.

Israel has made it clear it does not want a two-state solution by its decades-long program of building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. 

The United States, despite what it says, has made it clear it does not want a two-state solution by refusing to recognize a Palestinian state and continuing to send billions of dollars to Israel each year despite the human rights abuses and land grabs.

I ask you as President to at least:
1. Cut off all military, economic and diplomatic aid to Israel. I was horrified to learn that we are sending 45,000 shells to further bombard the civilian population of Gaza.
2. Recognize a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders
3. Establish an American Embassy to Palestine in East Jerusalem. 
4. Demand that Israel recall all "settlers" in the occupied territories

Of course, the just solution would be the one-state solution where Israel makes citizens of all Palestinians in the occupied territories and allow the return of those that fled to surrounding countries and their descendants. 

Thank you.
