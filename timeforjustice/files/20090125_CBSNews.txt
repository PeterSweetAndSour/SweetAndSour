Thank you, thank you CBS! Finally the daily humiliation of Palestinians under Israeli occupation is shown to Americans.

The soldiers in the Palestinian house are particularly instructive - if there was a real military need, the IDF would just build a tower and leave the family alone. Clearly their real aim is to make life so utterly impossible for the family that they are forced to leave and as the Palestinian doctor found, once you leave, you are never allowed back - slow-motion ethnic cleansing.

The PLO recognized Israel and renounced violence so it could participate in the Oslo accords with the aim of securing a Palestinian state but rather than help lay the foundations of a Palestinian state, Israel made its intentions clear by accelerating construction of Jewish. Many Palestinians therefore took away the lesson that talking was a ruse to keep them quiet and therefore the only option is to fight but then they are labeled "terrorists".

Jewish groups have been successful recovering art stolen by the Nazis nd bank accounts stolen by the Swiss. Why can't they recognize that the Palestinians want their land and houses back? Until the dispossession of the Palestinians is addressed, there can never be peace. If Israel refuses them the Right of Return, it needs to compensate them so they can make a new life wherever they are now. Instead of bombing infrastructure as they just did in Gaza, they need to be building it for the people whose land they have taken.
