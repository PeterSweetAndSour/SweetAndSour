I don't see any mention that the Israeli Supreme Court has demanded that the IDF allow access to Gaza by foreign journalists but the IDF has ignored that ruling. I guess they don't want the world to see what they are doing.

US and Israeli officials often insist on Israel's right to defend itself but they apparently deny that right to Palestinians. It is the Palestinians that have lost their houses and land and are being killed in far greater numbers by the IDF. Until the dispossession of the Palestinian people is recognized as the fundamental cause of the conflict, the bloodshed will go on.
