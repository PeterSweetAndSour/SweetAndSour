Dear Mr. President,

Re: Gaza

I am embarrassed to be an American and have your administration block any demand for a ceasefire in the latest UN Security Council resolution. It appears that you value AIPAC's political support more than you care about the killing and displacement of people in Gaza.

The Israelis will kill or capture every member of Hamas and yet do nothing to address the underlying cause of the violence - the ethnic cleansing that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948 and the refusal by Israel to allow Arab residents to return home after the fighting. 

Nearly everyone in Gaza descends from those that fled the fighting, or were expelled at gunpoint by Jewish militias. The position of Israel and the US seems to be that the residents of Gaza - and those on the West Bank - should be happy with the cage into which they have been forced.

If the war in 1948 had gone the other way and there were 2.1 million Jews inside Gaza, of which 85% had now been displaced by fighting, I find it inconceivable the US would be sending billions of dollars in aid to an Arab state that controlled the lives of so many Jews.

I ask you to:
1. Stop any further economic, military and diplomatic aid to Israel.
2. Demand that Israel withdraw to its 1967 borders - or to show good faith - to the 1947 borders proposed in the UN Partition Plan so that the Arab and Jewish populations get half each.
4. If the Israelis resuse to withdraw, then demand that Israel become the democracy they say they are - demand a 1-state solution so the Occupied Territories are incorporated into Israel and all Palestinians get the vote. 
5. Recognize the Palestinian state.

Israel has shown over decades that it does not share our values. Its "settlement" project makes clear that it has no interest in a 2-state solution. It should not be enabled to commit further human rights abuses by our support.

Merry Christmas.
