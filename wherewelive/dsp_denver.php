	<p>Before arriving in the US, we were told we would be sent to Cedar Rapids in Iowa.  Since neither of us knew much about the country, it didn't matter much where we lived.  Cedar Rapids seemed harmless enough from what we could determine but Lan got sick and so we had to delay our departure.</p>
	<p>By the time we arrived, someone else had been sent to Cedar Rapids so we waited for Lan&rsquo;s company to decide what to do with us.  It turned out to be Denver and that turned out to be a stroke of luck.  As you&rsquo;ll see from the photos below, it is a beautiful place and there are lots of interesting places to visit within driving distance.  Read about our travels in the Coming to America section.</p>
	<p>Metropolitan Denver has about 2 million inhabitants making it about half the size of Sydney.</p>
