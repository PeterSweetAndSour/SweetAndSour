			<h2>Kitchen Layouts</h2>
			<div class="story">
				<h2>Old design 1</h2>
				<p>This assumed retaining the existing standard door on the backwall but adding a window over the sink so you could look over the back yard while washing dishes. There was room for a small table, say 4x2&frac12;ft, by the existing window. The sink is a Blanco 440161 which fits in a 30" cabinet; I find most American sinks too big and too deep to be useful.</p>

				<h2>Old design 2</h2>
				<p>First design incorporating a new 6ft wide door (sliding or French) on the back wall. A smaller table to allow eating in the kitchen is now on the wall we share with a neighbor but to make entry/exit possible, it would have to be attached to the wall and have a single leg. The sink moves to the existing window and we recognize that there will be a small well behind the bench since the bottom of the window is only 29.5" above the floor. The dishwasher almost moves next to the sink; it was in the island but that would complicate plumbing and also means the island would have to be fixed; I'm hoping the island doesn't have to be fastened to the floor so we can move it a few inches if necessary to adjust clearances.</p>

				<h2>Old design 3</h2>
				<p>The kitchen now swings around the corner but I don't like corner cabinets despite various modern devices to make the space at the back less inaccessible. I realized that the range hood can't exhaust through the wall it is on because of DC Historic Preservation requirements so I moved the stove and range close to the back wall.</p>

				<h2>Old design 4</h2>
				<p>Lan preferred having tall cabinets where I had the table on the wall we share with the neighbor. I felt strongly that if we removed that table, we needed to make the dining area more accessible so I added a second door. I removed some of the cabinets from the island so you can sit at stools there but I know in practice that countertop will likely get covered and two people aren't facing each other so it is less than ideal for eating.</p>

				<h2>Old design 5</h2>
				<p>Much the same as 4 above but the refrigerator and cabinet with microwave swap. I was thinking it would be neat to have the right door of the refrigerator open through the door to the living room but I realized that for the refrigerator door to open fully, the cabinet would have to be flush with the door frame and so the fridge would partially block the opening.</p>
				<p>Note that the cabinet with the microwave is 24" wide, not 30" although I'm aware that 30" is the standard size for built-ins. I'd rather have the extra 6" of countertop and buy a regular (and much cheaper) standalone microwave though we will of course need an electrical outlet behind the cabinet and if we buy a standard Ikea cabinet, I'll need to modify the door to split it and mount 2 extra hinges and another handle. I also realize we could get a combined microwave and rangehood but my Asian wife does a lot of cooking that needs a powerful rangehood and she is fairly short so a microwave up high is awkward for her, even dangerous. I was thinking of using <a href="http://www.fabykahood.com/pro_show.asp?sp_id=142">this rangehood from Fabyka</a> though I see they are currently out of stock.</p>
