	<p>Actually, we lived in Alexandria, Virginia 2006 &ndash; 2011 which is across the Potomac River but it 
		is in the Washington metropolitan area. 	If traveling overseas, an Australian 
		from the Sydney suburb of Auburn would tell people they met that they lived in Sydney 
		knowing that the listener would not be familiar with Auburn but it seems that most 
		Americans, at least older ones, make the distinction and would say  &quot;Alexandria
		near Washington&quot; or &quot;Lakewood near Denver&quot;. I don't know if this has
		always been the case or is a result of the 
		&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight" target="_blank" class="external">white flight</a>&quot;
		that left most American city centers poor and black.
	</p>
	<p>However, in the case of Alexandria, the difference probably is significant since Alexandria and Washington were on 
	opposing sides in the Civil War. The state capital 	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_VA" target="_blank" class="external">Richmond</a>
	is just 150km/90 miles was the capital of the slave-holding Confederacy, the &quot;South&quot; while Washington was the captital 
	of the 	abolitionist &quot;North&quot;. Indeed, if you look at a map of the District of Columbia, the state-like entity that the city of Washington completely fils, you will see the section to the south/west of the Potomac is not included. It was originally but slave trading interests in the port of Alexandria worried about their business so they seceded and went back to being part of Virginia.
	</p>
	<p>Then we bought a &ldquo;renovator&apos;ls delight&rdquo; in DC in late 2009 had a builder <a href="index.php?fuseAction=houserenovation">rebuild the inside</a> and moved in April 2011, staying there until 2019.</p>
	<p class="endText">
		In any case, I'll have lots more to say about Washington but you already know it is the
		center of world power and that there are lots of things to see in the area. More about
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria%2C_Virginia" target="_blank" class="external">Alexandria</a>
