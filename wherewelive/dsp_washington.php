	<p>Actually, we live in Alexandria, Virginia which is across the Potomac River but it 
	is in the Washington metropolitan area. 	If traveling overseas, an Australian 
	from the Sydney suburb of Auburn would tell people they met that they lived in Sydney 
	knowing that the listener would not be familiar with Auburn but it seems that most 
	Americans, at least older ones, make the distinction and would say  &quot;Alexandria
	near Washington&quot; or &quot;Lakewood near Denver&quot;. I don't know if this has
	always been the case or is a result of the 
	&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight" target="_blank" class="external">white flight</a>&quot;
	that left most American city centers poor and black.
	</p>
	<p>However, in the case of Alexandria, the difference probably is significant since Alexandria and Washington were on 
	opposing sides in the Civil War. The state capital 	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_VA" target="_blank" class="external">Richmond</a>
	is just 150km/90 miles was the capital of the slave-holding Confederacy, the &quot;South&quot; while Washington was the captital 
	of the 	abolitionist &quot;North&quot;.

	In any case, I'll have lots more to say about Washington but you already know it is the
	center of world power and that there are lots of things to see in the area. More about
