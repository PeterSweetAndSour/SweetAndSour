			<p>When damp spots appeared inside the back wall, a test hole was drilled outside the basement door to see if water was backing up behind the retaining wall. Water did indeed seep out and for several days it carried a black oily substance. Since it was January and the air temperature was lower than the ground temperature, the oil became more viscous and accumulated once outside.</p>
<p>We think the wall was coated with tar prior to backfilling but if so, it was not given time to dry before the soil was packed against it allowing the lighter components that might otherwise have evaporated to come out in the water instead.</p>		</div>
