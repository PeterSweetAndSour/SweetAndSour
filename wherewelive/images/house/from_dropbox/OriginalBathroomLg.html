			<p>The selling agent made not on shred of effort to making the house look decent for sale, not even flushing the toilet which had been used for a &ldquo;number 2&rdquo; and stank. The water had been turned off as I think there was an unpaid water bill but I was able to use the large water bottle shown to get water from a tap at the school next door to flush it. It appeared that the agent's attitude was that the original owner was dead, the family lived some distance away and he wasn't going to do anything if he could make a sale and get a commission.</p>		</div>
