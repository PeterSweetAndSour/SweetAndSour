			<p>I'm 99% sure that the ditzy woman at Keil Construction who was supposedly our Project Manager saw this drawing I made which was intended to show which of the two French doors opened first but assumed that only one side opened. How could she be so stupid? The back door sat inside the house for two or three months while we argued about whether the back wall would be rebuilt rather than just patched and nobody noticed that one side was fixed, at least we didn't.</p>
<p>In the end we agreed to accept the door as part of the agreement for him rebuilding the back wall properly. Having one side fixed does allow a conventional sliding insect screen and it is better sealed but getting large items in and out is obviously more difficult&mdash;to get the refrigerator in, we had to take the door off and even then it only just made it through. It would have been so easy if both doors opened.</p>		</div>
