			<p>Before the subsidence there was some minor cracking and it wasn't sloped toward the back yard so water did pool in the breezeway and some of it leaked through the cracks into our crawl space. The builder had suggested replacing it and possibly fitting a drain. I expected he'd have the concrete delivered when the slab was poured so the extra cost would be marginal, perhaps $500 but he sent us a bill for $3000! He did fit a drain and that required a fair bit of digging but it was an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Before the subsidence it was arguable whether this was necessary; after the subsidence this concrete had to be replaced. I agreed to pay to keep the job moving but I resented being put in this situation.</p>		</div>
