			<p>The back wall should have been the least likely to leak since excavation left the outside exposed allowing it to be rebuilt rather than underpinning the original foundations and therefore there was ample opportunity to ensure the wall was waterproof. We have a photograph suggesting that plastic sheeting was laid against the wall before backfilling and subsequently oily gunk oozed out a hole drilled from the entry area suggesting the wall had been coated with bitumen but it had not set.</p>
<p>When water first appeared higher up, the builder laid a concrete pad that stretched about 3ft/1m from the wall hoping to stop rain water penetrating too close to the wall. Over a month or so the upper wet spot dried but the lower ones did not. The concrete blocks should have been filled with reinforcing rods and concrete but test holes revealed that it was a lousy job and the wall was partly hollow.</p>		</div>
