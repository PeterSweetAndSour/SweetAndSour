			<p>The wall to the right that separates the living room from the hallway (which gets <em>very</em> narrow as it passes the stairs will go. So to will the wall visible through the opening on the right that separates the dining room from the living room creating one big room.</p>
<p>Apparently at the time the house was built, heated by burning coal which was a nuisance so to minimize cost and effort, each space was heated separately. There was another fire in the kitchen and the upstairs bedroom would get warmth from the chimney and the hot air rising from downstairs but they must still have been cold.</p>
<p>I suggested we make the kitchen open to the main room but Lan''s style of cooking sometimes generates a lot of steam and smell so she thought it best to keep the kitchen walled off which is what we did.</p>		</div>
