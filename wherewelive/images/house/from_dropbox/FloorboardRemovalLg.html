			<p>We are in the master bedroom looking at the area that will be the second bathroom. The floorboards in this 5'x10'/1.5x3m (50 sq.ft/4.5 sq.m) area have been removed in preparation for tiling and replaced with plywood</p>
<p>Floorboards were also removed from the 12 sq.ft (1.1 sq.m) in the vestibule and 7.5 sq.ft/ (0.7 sq.m) in the closet where the washer/drier was to be installed &ndash; almost 70 sq.ft/6.5 sq.m in total.</p>
<p>We knew we needed some around the new gas fireplace since it is much smaller than the back-to-back fireplaces that came out requiring perhaps 30 sq.ft/2.8 sq.m plus other lesser amounts around the house. It seems there should have been a lot left over but there we were short when we discovered a 3ft/1m square in the living room that had to be replaced. We suspect but can't prove that some of our floorboards were taken off site to use on another job.</p> 		</div>
