			<p>Rather than paint all the woodwork white which was the builder's intention, we thought it would be better to use polyurethane clearcoat and we offered to do it ourselves. We covered all the bottom timber in blue painter's tape so the balusters could be painted white without the painter needing to be too concerned about accuracy. After he was done, we removed the tape and very carefully applied clearcoat to the bottom timber. The builder then had his painter apply a second coat but he clearly took no care at all and slopped it over the bottom of the balusters.</p>
<p>It would have been better for him to do nothing than do it this badly. The builder had two of his better workers carefully paint white over the places like this on the main staircase and upstairs landing but the downstairs horizontal section remains affected and I'll have to do it one day.</p>		</div>
