			<p>In the Scope of Work document that formed part of the contract, we explicitly asked that the garage be fixed first so that we could store our <a href="http://sweetandsour.org/canoe/" target="_blank">canoe</a>. It was secured to the rafters of the garage with a steel cable for locking bicycles but someone entered the unlockable garage in May, cut the cable and stole it. I thought the builder would have fixed the garage first if only so he could store building materials in there but apparently that wasn't a sufficient motivation.</p>		</div>
