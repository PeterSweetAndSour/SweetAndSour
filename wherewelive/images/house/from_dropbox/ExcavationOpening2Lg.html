			<p>This is considerably larger than the approved plans suggested which was a single door at basement level and the double door (6ft/1.9m) at ground level. In fact the left edge is at the left side of new the double door while the right edge is the right side of the original single door making an opening about 10ft/3m wide.</p>
<p>The immediate problem this caused was that it alarmed someone from the Historic Preservation Review Board reviewing our application to bring the stairs from the basement door in the back wall to street level in the &quot;public space&quot; adjacent to the sidewalk. They called  called the DCRA (building department) and an inspector came to see and he issued a Stop Work Order.</p>
<p>The less obvious problem was that the weight of the upper level was now bearing on less wall thus concentrating the load on what remained. This was to have disastrous consequences later.</p>		</div>
