			<p>There are several ways to build stairs. The easiest is to set the treads (the horizontal boards that you step on) and risers (the vertical boards) <em>inside</em> the stringers (the sloping beams that are the main structural element. A better look is obtained if the stringers are notched so that the stringers are hidden from view.</p>
<p>The best support at the top is to lean the stringer against the floor beam but then the first &ldquo;step&rdquo; is at the level of the upper floor like <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rfAPQ9lRbng/TmfgbyliOLI/AAAAAAAAAWM/pSACOhws4gc/s1600/building+deck+stairs+057.jpg" class="external" target="_blank">this</a>. In our case, the first step from the top was set down from the top floor level but since the riser height (7") is only a little smaller than the height of the beam (7½"), there is only a ½" to rest the string against. The carpenter tried to provide some extra bearing surface by setting two 2x4 under the floor beam.</p>
<p>A building inspector we hired (at our expense) noted with alarm that the 2x4s were held on only with a few drywall screws and so the staircase likely would have collapsed when several men attempted to get the 500lb/230kg bathtub to the upstairs bathroom. The builder addressed this by inserting two 8" lag screws but I was disappointed that his men didn't bother to fit washers. It doesn't <em>really</em> matter since the screws are loaded in shear rather than in tension but it was poor craftsmanship nevertheless.</p>		</div>
