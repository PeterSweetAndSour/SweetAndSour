			<p>Hopefully she has finally been fired but I was shocked/disappointed/angry that our so-called project manager Karen called me and asked how white our choice of tiles from Home Depot are. We chose them because we liked them and they were cheap! In the quantities that Home Depot buys, they get some incredible deals that places like Morris Tile can't possibly match. Karen said they get other tiles from Morris and wanted to get their equivalent. I told her to just go to Home Depot.</p>
<p>She contacted me again and said I should choose from the catalog of whatever manufacturer made an equivalent product that Morris Tile stocked. I looked but I think their flat tiles were twice the price and the rope and listel tiles were five times as much! I told her to go to Home Depot but on our inspection that weekend we saw they already had the flat tiles from Morris. We told the builder and it seemed everyone now agreed they would get the tiles from Home Depot as we requested from the beginning but the flat tiles from Morris went up on the wall and then they used the rope and listel tiles from Home Depot since they were so much cheaper. The shade of white was <em>clearly</em> different when they were next to each other.</p>
<p>We reached a compromise so that the rope tiles were replaced by black ones so the color change is separated and now it is only noticeable if it is pointed out but this incident was so typical of dealing with Keil Construction that every step had to be checked and when it wasn't right, argued over. It was so time-consuming and tiring.</p>		</div>
