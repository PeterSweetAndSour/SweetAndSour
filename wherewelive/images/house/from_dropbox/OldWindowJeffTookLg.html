			<p>We had the old window frames outside ready to be tossed out but someone walking by said they might be worth something, perhaps to artists who paint a different picture on each of the six panels, so we moved them back to the basement. We were there one Sunday when the builder came in to take two of them away. In his view they were now building debris; Lan asked him to leave them but he took them anyway.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that his contract did not make explicit who owns anything that can be recovered. In theory you could recover copper from old wiring, get scrap metal value for old radiators and sell old windows and doors. Even if it is only a token amount it is grater than zero. For most home owners it probably isn't worth the trouble and leaving it behind just creates clutter but it would be nice to make that clear.</p>		</div>
