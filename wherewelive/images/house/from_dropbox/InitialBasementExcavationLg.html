			<p>This, more than anything, made our renovation experience a nightmare. It caused delays while we figured out what today, added significantly to the cost and it reduced the bearing capacity of the soil, which combined with the excessively wide opening in the back wall and inadequate temporary support, led to the subsidence damage our house and that of our neighbor.</p>
<p>My first measurement of the flow on the east side was 240 gallons or 900 liters per day! It was relatively constant over the following few months varying from 200 after a long dry spell to over 300 after rain.</p>
<p>Given that we are near the top of a shallow hill and that our neighbors 6 and 7 doors away have basements with no water issues and one doesn't even have a pump, we naturally assumed that there had to be a broken water pipe nearby.</p>
<p>WASA, the local water utility company, made a serious effort to determine if it was one of their pipes since they have an interest in ensuring that they are not losing their product. They checked the meters of all our neighbors to see if the meter was still turning over when everything in the house was shut off and found no problems. They did chemical tests 3 times looking for chlorine and fluorine which is in city water but not rain water and the first test suggested it might be city water but the second and third were negative. We even paid for an independent test but that was negative too. An important caveat to the chemical tests though is that even if water is left standing in a bucket, chlorine (and fluorine?) dissipate quickly but once in contact with the soil, all bets are off. </p>
<p>Even though the water was perfectly clear, I considered the possibility of a broken sewer pipe since dirt makes an excellent filter and so wondered if testing for biological matter might prove it but we were told that soil is so full of it anyway that testing was useless. Unlike water supply pipes, sewer lines are not under pressure so any leaks are likely to be limited. </p>
<p>The DC government web site has an <a href="http://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis_allservices/viewer.htm" title="Atlas All-in-One" class="external" target="_blank">online mapping service</a> with all sorts of data layers such as historical maps, land use, floor plains and so on but what I cared about was elevation. I created a <a href="../files/Elevations.pdf" title="Document with maps of elevations" target="_blank">document showing elevations around us</a>. It is quite clear that the only higher ground is a few blocks to the north-west of us but there is nothing in the surface topology that suggests it would get funneled toward us.</p>
<p>We reluctantly concluded that either the subsoil conditions direct water towards us or possibly that there are broken pipes under the adjacent school since their water use might be high enough to mask a significant loss so we had to plan for water always being present. (Having now lived here during the school holidays, I think we can rule out the school being the problem as the pumps kept going.)</p>
<p>The builder agreed to proceed if we paid an extra $11,000 to cover deeper excavation to allow a gravel bed under the basement concrete slab to be increased from 4"/10cm to 12"/30cm and deeper foundation underpinning. We also paid $600 to a geotechnical engineer to take a look and make recommendations which was a single sketch, no doubt recycled from many previous projects. </p>
<p>Lan''s  brother-in-law who is a civil engineer and has experience in such things also sent us instructions and drawings on how to handle the underpinning and drainage which I redid on the computer for clarity (see <a href="../files/TomsExcavationRecommendations.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Underpinning and drainage instructions">instructions</a>, <a href="../files/TomsSketch1.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Sketch 1">diagram 1</a>, <a href="../files/TomsSketch2.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" title="Sketch 2">diagram 2</a>. The builder did look at the original hand-written notes but was largely disinterested assuming his excavation contractor knew what to do which was a dangerous assumption. </p>		</div>
