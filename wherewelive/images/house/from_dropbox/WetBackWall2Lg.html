			<p>Wet areas appeared on the back wall almost as soon as the wall was backfilled in January 2011. These patches are near ground level so the thought was that this was rain water penetrating through the soil then through the wall. The builder said the problem would go away when the porch was built but in an attempt to address the issue sooner, a concrete pad was laid on the ground extending about 3ft/1m from the back wall. That seemed to do the trick … for a while.</p>		</div>
