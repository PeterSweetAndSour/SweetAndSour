			<p>Although the house was originally constructed with beams spanning the full width of the house (15'7"/4.75m), the floor clearly bounced too much. A previous owner installed a beam running north-south (parallel with the long axis of the house) under the middle of the floor from the kitchen wall to perhaps halfway towards the front of the living room. One end was supported by the steel post seen here while the other end was on a short post of bricks as the crawl space there was on a foot (0.3m) or so.</p> 
<p>During basement excavation this extra support was removed and not replaced so the floor bounced when walking over it which wasn't a problem till we put our china cabinet against the wall and everything shook when you walked by.</p>
<p>I made my own temporary bracing.</p>		</div>
