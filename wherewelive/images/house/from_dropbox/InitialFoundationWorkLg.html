			<p>The approved plans were annotated by the DCRA to explicitly prohibit the use of concrete blocks when underpinning the foundations but that happened anyway. I'm not actually sure that the subcontractor ever saw the drawings as I think they relied on verbal instructions from the builder. In any case, this was the other reason that the building inspector issued a Stop Work Order.</p>
<p>I was perplexed that the new blocks were not directly under the wall but set well back and I still suspect this was not supposed to be the actually underpinning but only the back of a concrete form. I never got to find out as this subcontractor was fired and the new one used solid concrete so I never found out how this was supposed to work.</p>		</div>
