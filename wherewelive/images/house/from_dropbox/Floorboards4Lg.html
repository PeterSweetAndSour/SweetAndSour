			<p>There are white marks under the polyurethane clear coat. There were two big patches like this, one in the bay window of the bedroom and one near the bay window in the living room plus smaller patches elsewhere. I thought it was drywall dust that had not been vacuumed off the floor before the polyurethane was applied. The builder thought there was some chemical reaction going on between the modern sealants and something that had been applied in the past. The men doing the polyurethane were incredibly sloppy, getting polyurethane on the baseboards which had to be painted over later so I think the former more likely.</p>
<p>The builder did have the flooring people come back and sand the affected area near the front of both the living and bedrooms and apply another coat of polyurethane over the while living/dining room and master bedroom. In part this was necessary because in the rush to get the job finished so we could move in, the original applications of polyurethane hadn't been given enough time to harden and were badly scuffed.</p>
<p>We still have a small area in the middle of the living room where this effect is visible though the nearby mis-matched boards are more of an issue.</p>		</div>
