			<p>The subsidence occurred right here. The large opening to the right concentrated the weight of the upper-level wall in this area but the water-saturated soil below had reduced bearing capacity. When the soil underneath the foundation just to the left of the corner was removed in preparation for underpinning, the weight was concentrated even further and the soil could not support the weight. The corner and the northern section of the west wall pivoted outwards (to the north) over a section of newly underpinned foundation further to the left which was stronger.</p>
<p>The door to the basement was supposed to be in the back wall at the corner but in an effort to avert collapse, extra concrete was poured to the right of the corner to give it more footing. The door was then offset from the stairs which is unfortunate as it is now harder to get anything long and bulky in through the door.</p>		</div>
