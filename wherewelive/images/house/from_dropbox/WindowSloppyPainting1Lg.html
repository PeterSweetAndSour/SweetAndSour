			<p>We didn''t know until after we moved in that the sliding sections of the windows were removable. Apparently neither was the painter. Wooden windows are awkward to paint and so had the painter known earlier, he could have done a much better job (and better still if they had been painted before installation). With the lower panel removed you can see white paint where it should be all blue.</p>
<p>We insisted that the builder have his painter do the windows again. The upper panel on this window is not completely stuck. Like so much on this project, it would have been quicker, cheaper and less stressful for everyone to have done it right the first time.</p>		</div>
